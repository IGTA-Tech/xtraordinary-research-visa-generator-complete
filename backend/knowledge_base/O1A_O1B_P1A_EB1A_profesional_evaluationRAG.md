### REDUNDANCY AND DIMINISHING RETURNS

**Principle:** Multiple pieces of similar evidence provide diminishing value

**Rules:**
1. **First instance:** Full point value
2. **Second similar instance:** 75% of points
3. **Third similar instance:** 50% of points
4. **Fourth+ similar instances:** 25% of points

**Example:**
- 1st ESPN article: 25 points
- 2nd ESPN article: 19 points (75%)
- 3rd ESPN article: 12 points (50%)
- 4th ESPN article: 6 points (25%)

**Justification:** After establishing coverage in a publication, additional articles show sustained coverage but aren't as impactful as initial recognition

---

### EVIDENCE FRESHNESS WEIGHTING

**Recency Matters:**
- **Last 2 years:** Full weight
- **2-5 years ago:** 90% weight
- **5-8 years ago:** 75% weight
- **8+ years ago:** 50% weight

**Exception:** Historical achievements that established reputation (championships, awards) retain full weight

### C. Purpose of Petition

This petition seeks [visa type] classification to allow Beneficiary to [purpose - work/compete/etc.] in the United States [temporarily / permanently]. The evidence submitted demonstrates that Beneficiary meets the regulatory requirements for this classification.

---

## III. LEGAL STANDARDS

### A. Statutory and Regulatory Framework

[FOR EB-1A:]

The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) Â§ 203(b)(1)(A) provides for classification of aliens with extraordinary ability as priority workers. The regulation at 8 CFR Â§ 204.5(h)(2) defines extraordinary ability as:

> "A level of expertise indicating that the individual is one of that small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field of endeavor."

An alien can establish extraordinary ability through evidence of:
1. A one-time achievement (major internationally-recognized award), OR
2. Meeting at least three of the ten criteria listed at 8 CFR Â§ 204.5(h)(3)

### B. Two-Step Kazarian Analysis

[FOR EB-1A - CRITICAL]

Under Kazarian v. USCIS, 596 F.3d 1115 (9th Cir. 2010), USCIS must employ a two-step analysis:

**Step One:** Determine whether the petitioner has submitted evidence meeting at least three of the ten regulatory criteria (or one-time achievement).

**Step Two:** Conduct a final merits determination considering the totality of the evidence to determine whether the petitioner has demonstrated, by a preponderance of evidence, that they have sustained national or international acclaim and are one of the small percentage who have risen to the very top of their field.

**Important:** Each step must be conducted separately. Evidence meeting a criterion in Step One must still be considered in Step Two for the final merits determination.

### C. Preponderance of Evidence Standard

The petitioner must demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence, meaning it is more likely than not that the requirements are met. Matter of Chawathe, 25 I&N Dec. 369 (AAO 2010).

### D. Comparable Evidence Provision

[IF USING COMPARABLE EVIDENCE:]

If the regulatory criteria do not readily apply to the beneficiary's occupation, 8 CFR Â§ 204.5(h)(4) allows submission of comparable evidence. The comparable evidence must be of similar nature to the criteria and demonstrate the beneficiary's extraordinary ability.
