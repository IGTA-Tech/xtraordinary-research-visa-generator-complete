# USCIS Policy Memos: P-1A, P-1B, P-1S, and O-2 Visas (2015-2025)

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of all major USCIS policy memoranda, policy manual updates, and regulatory guidance affecting P-1A (Internationally Recognized Athletes), P-1B (Entertainment Groups), P-1S (Essential Support Personnel), and O-2 (Accompanying O-1 Support Personnel) visa categories from 2015 through 2025.

**Key Finding:** Unlike O-1 and EB-1A visas, the P and O-2 visa categories have seen relatively few policy updates over the past decade. The primary policy updates relate to AFM consolidation into the Policy Manual and procedural clarifications rather than substantive changes to eligibility criteria.

## CROSS-CUTTING O AND P VISA POLICIES

**Type:** Policy Memorandum
**Author:** Donald Neufeld, Acting Associate Director, Domestic Operations
**Reference:** PM HQ 70/6.2.18, HQ 70/6.2.19
**Title:** "Requirements for Agents and Sponsors Filing as Petitioners for the O and P Visa Classifications"

**Context:**
This memo is one of the most important policy documents for O and P visas, affecting O-1, O-2, P-1A, P-1B, and P-1S petitions filed through agents.

**Key Provisions:**

## ADJUDICATION TRENDS

### O-2 Visas:
- Generally high approval rates when properly documented
- Most denials due to:
  - General rather than critical skills
  - Insufficient relationship with O-1
  - Available U.S. workers
- RFEs common for unclear essential nature

### P-1A Visas:
- Approval rates vary by sport and level
- Major league athletes: Very high approval
- Individual athletes: More scrutiny
- Most denials:
  - Insufficient international recognition
  - Event not distinguished
  - Weak evidence

### P-1B Visas:
- Moderate approval rates
- Most denials due to:
  - **75% rule failure** (most common)
  - Insufficient international recognition
  - Group not established long enough
- Success depends heavily on documentation quality

### P-1S Visas:
- High approval when tied to approved P-1
- Denials usually for:
  - General rather than specialized skills
  - U.S. workers available
  - Unclear essentiality

## NOTES FOR VISA SCORING BLUEPRINT PROJECT

### Implications for Scoring Systems:

#### P-1A Scoring Considerations:
- Major league participation should be heavily weighted
- International competition (Olympics, World Championships) high value
- National team participation very strong
- College competition (NCAA Division I) moderate value
- Rankings depend on sport (some sports have no rankings)
- Expert statements important corroborating evidence
- Event quality assessment critical

#### P-1B Scoring Considerations:
- **75% rule compliance = PASS/FAIL** (not scored)
- International recognition across countries (not just one)
- Sustained period (1+ year) = threshold requirement
- Performance history and consistency
- Media coverage from multiple countries
- Awards from international bodies
- Commercial success metrics

#### P-1S Scoring Considerations:
- Prior relationship with P-1 principal
- Specialized certifications/licenses
- Experience level in support capacity
- Essentiality demonstration
- Non-availability of U.S. workers

#### O-2 Scoring Considerations:
- Relationship duration with O-1
- Critical skills documentation
- For MPTV: Production schedule showing international work
- Uniqueness of skills
- Prior collaboration evidence

### Key Differences from O-1/EB-1A:
- P and O-2 visas have **fewer published policy changes**
- More **stable requirements** over time
- **Less comparable evidence flexibility**
- **More rigid categorical requirements** (especially 75% rule for P-1B)
- **Relationship-dependent** (P-1S and O-2 require principal visa)
