## EB-2 NIW POLICY CHANGES

### 2016: Matter of Dhanasar (December 27, 2016)
**Type:** Precedent Decision (Administrative Appeals Office)
**Citation:** 26 I&N Dec. 884 (AAO 2016)

**Context:**
This landmark decision fundamentally reformed the National Interest Waiver framework, replacing the nearly 20-year-old Matter of New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) standard.

**Key Changes:**
- **Vacated NYSDOT Framework** - Eliminated the previous three-prong test that was deemed insufficiently flexible
- **New Three-Prong Framework:**
  1. **Prong 1:** The foreign national's proposed endeavor has both substantial merit AND national importance
  2. **Prong 2:** The foreign national is well positioned to advance the proposed endeavor
  3. **Prong 3:** On balance, it would be beneficial to the United States to waive the job offer and labor certification requirements

**Impact:**
- Created more flexibility for both petitioning employers and self-petitioning individuals
- Shifted focus from comparing to U.S. workers to the inherent value of the proposed work
- Broadened the types of endeavors that could qualify (business, entrepreneurship, STEM, etc.)
- No longer requires showing that national interest would be "adversely affected" if labor certification were required
- Allowed for endeavors with regional focus to still have national importance

**Approval Rates Post-Dhanasar:**
- 2018: 91%
- 2019: 90%
- 2020: 85%
- 2021: 86%
- 2022: 90%
- 2023: 80%

## NOTES FOR VISA SCORING BLUEPRINT PROJECT

### Implications for Scoring System:

1. **O-1 Visas:**
   - Include self-sponsorship scenarios
   - Weight early-career achievements appropriately
   - Account for career transition pathways
   - STEM-specific scoring rubrics

2. **EB-1A Visas:**
   - Team awards should score under awards criterion
   - Past memberships have value
   - Published material - broader interpretation
   - Maintain higher threshold than O-1A
   - Two-step Kazarian analysis required

3. **EB-2 NIW Visas:**
   - January 2025 update requires higher evidence standards
   - EB-2 qualification is now threshold requirement
   - Three Dhanasar prongs remain core framework
   - Entrepreneur cases need substantial objective evidence
   - Letters/plans must be corroborated

### Scoring Adjustments Based on Policy Changes:
- Consider recalibrating NIW thresholds higher post-January 2025
- Team awards add value for EB-1A scoring
- O-1 early-career founders may score higher than previously
- Published material criterion should be weighted differently for EB-1A
