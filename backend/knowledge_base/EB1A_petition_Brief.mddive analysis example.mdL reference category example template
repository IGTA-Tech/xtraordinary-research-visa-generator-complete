C. COMPARABLE EVIDENCE JUSTIFICATION

In martial arts, traditional "judging" roles (competition judges, peer reviewers) 
don't readily apply to active competitors. However, elite training partner roles 
involve:
- Assessment of techniques during sparring
- Skill evaluation for teammates
- Technical consultation based on experience
- Quality control for championship preparation

This represents comparable evidence of ability to evaluate others' work in the 
martial arts context.
