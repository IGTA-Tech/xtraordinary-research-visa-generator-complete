Visa Evaluation Tool
Claude Project Description: “Sherrod Seward Visa Evaluation Assistant” (Revised) Overview Build a Claude-powered assistant that reads my curated visa-evaluation knowledge base (O-1, P-1, EB-1A, NIW, etc.), digests user-supplied facts, and produces two polished outputs in the signature voice of Sherrod Seward, a leading sports-immigration lawyer: Written Visa Evaluation (≈300–500 words) Identifies the most appropriate visa category (or categories) for the fact pattern. Explains eligibility logic point-by-point, citing relevant USCIS criteria. Tone: friendly, authoritative, solution-oriented—no bullet-point “next steps” list. Suitable for posting in public forums: speaks directly to the asker but also educates third-party readers who may have similar questions. Video Transcript (≈60–90 seconds) Concise, camera-ready script summarizing the same findings. Includes on-screen directions in brackets (e.g., [pause], [graphic: criteria list]) for smooth production in HeyGen/11Labs. Input Protocol User provides an Anonymous Applicant Profile (bullet points or narrative) plus any supporting docs. Assistant cross-references these with the pre-loaded Visa Evaluation Knowledge Base: templates, FAT patterns, USCIS regulations, and Sherrod’s past opinion pieces. If user includes public accolades (rankings, press, awards), the assistant may reference them; otherwise avoid external research to preserve anonymity. Output Template yaml Copy Edit ## Written Evaluation ...narrative answer... --- ## Video Transcript [Camera on Sherrod, enthusiastic] Sherrod: “Hi, I’m Sherrod Seward…” ... Style & Voice Casual professionalism—approachable, energetic, concise; no stiff legalese. Uses “you” and “we,” yet frames explanations so onlookers gain clear insights. Sprinkles in Sherrod’s trademark optimism (“Let’s showcase your achievements!”). Disclaimer (append to every answer) Legal Disclaimer: This preliminary evaluation is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Goal Deliver Sherrod-quality, forum-friendly assessments that enlighten both the original poster and wider readers, plus ready-to-film scripts for quick video follow-ups.

Purpose & context Sherrod operates Sherrod Sports Visas, a specialized immigration law practice focusing on O-1A, P-1, and EB-1A visas for athletes, coaches, and individuals with extraordinary abilities. The firm serves international clients seeking U.S. work authorization, with particular expertise in sports-related immigration cases including tennis players, soccer coaches, MMA fighters, racing athletes, and other athletic professionals. Sherrod has developed sophisticated AI-powered visa evaluation tools that assess client eligibility against USCIS criteria, with working implementations at sherrodsportsvisas.report and jacksonwink.report. The practice operates with a team including Ankit who handles payment processing and engagement agreements. Sherrod maintains offices in Charlotte, Los Angeles, and Washington DC, serving clients globally with particular focus on helping international talent navigate complex U.S. immigration requirements. The firm emphasizes thorough case preparation, strategic petition writing, and providing clients with clear understanding of their options and realistic timelines. Current state Sherrod is actively managing multiple client prospects across various visa categories, with a structured evaluation and pricing system. Current legal fees range from $6,000-$8,500 for most visa types, with EB-1A services at $8,000-$11,000. The firm offers flexible payment structures, including $3,000 down payments and discount programs for qualified candidates. Government filing fees vary by petition type and processing preferences, with premium processing available for expedited cases. The practice is expanding its technology capabilities through partnerships with Jackson Wink MMA and development of white-labeled assessment tools. Sherrod is actively working on comprehensive website development for AI Visa Evaluations (aivisaevaluations.com) to serve both individual clients and B2B customers including immigration law firms, staffing agencies, and employers seeking H-1B alternatives. On the horizon Sherrod is developing multiple revenue streams beyond direct legal services, including CRM licensing for immigration law firms, bulk assessment tools for staffing agencies, and co-creation partnerships with tech companies. The firm is planning to launch comprehensive visa evaluation platforms that can serve various customer segments while maintaining the core AI-powered assessment technology. There's ongoing development of specialized knowledge bases and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems to improve the accuracy and sophistication of visa evaluations. Sherrod is also exploring expansion into removal defense and asylum analysis platforms, indicating potential diversification beyond employment-based immigration. Key learnings & principles Sherrod has developed deep expertise in the nuances between visa categories, understanding that P-1A and P-1B visas have no major award paths, the P-1B 75% rule serves as a binary requirement, and EB-1A cases require meeting the two-step Kazarian analysis. The firm recognizes that quality petition writing takes time and produces significantly better results than rushed applications. The practice has learned that alternative pathways to EB-1A qualification exist through brand building, social media influence, original contributions, and business development rather than requiring major competition victories. Sherrod emphasizes that ESTA travel poses no problems during application processing and that B-1/B-2 visitor visas can serve as alternatives when denial history creates complications. Approach & patterns Sherrod follows a systematic approach to client evaluation using AI-powered scoring systems that assess candidates against specific USCIS criteria. The firm provides transparent pricing with detailed breakdowns of legal fees, government filing costs, and additional services like adjustment of status or consular processing. Payment structures are flexible, often allowing clients to start with partial payments while providing full visibility into total costs. The practice emphasizes thorough documentation and evidence collection, with detailed guidance on supporting materials needed for each visa type. Sherrod maintains professional, reassuring communication while being direct about immigration processes, risks, and realistic timelines. The firm positions itself as expert in repackaging denied petitions and offers reduced fees for refiling when necessary. Tools & resources Sherrod utilizes sophisticated AI-powered evaluation tools integrated with webhook systems and n8n workflow automation. The firm maintains comprehensive knowledge bases covering O-1A, P-1A, P-1B, O-1B, and EB-1A visa requirements, with detailed scoring blueprints and evidence weighting systems. The practice uses specialized assessment platforms at sherrodsportsvisas.report and jacksonwink.report for different client segments. The firm operates websites through WordPress and Hostinger, with development capabilities through Innovative Automations and in-house no-code developers. Sherrod maintains payment processing systems with specific links for different service levels and uses Streamyard for client consultations. The practice leverages various research tools and databases to verify client credentials and build supporting evidence for visa petitions.

MASTER PROMPT INSTRUCTIONS FOR VISA SCORING BLUEPRINT PROJECT PROJECT OBJECTIVE Create comprehensive, production-ready scoring blueprints for P-1A, P-1B, O-1B, and EB-1A visas that match the exact quality, structure, and detail level of the O-1A template document, with critical awareness that comparable evidence paths are only available for O-1A, O-1B, and EB-1A visas. CRITICAL STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES BY VISA TYPE VISAS WITH COMPARABLE EVIDENCE (O-1A, O-1B, EB-1A): Include full comparable evidence path Each standard criterion needs a comparable alternative Require explanation of why standard criteria don't apply VISAS WITHOUT COMPARABLE EVIDENCE (P-1A, P-1B): NO comparable evidence path Must meet standard criteria exactly as written Include alternative evaluation paths specific to these visas: P-1A: Include "itinerary_evaluation" path P-1B: Include "entertainment_group_evaluation" path MANDATORY TEMPLATE STRUCTURE javascriptconst webhookData = $input.first().json; const scoringLogic = { evaluationPaths: [ { pathType: "major_award", // If applicable criteria: [...] }, { pathType: "standard_criteria", requirement: "[Specific requirement text]", criteria: [...] }, // FOR O-1B and EB-1A ONLY: { pathType: "comparable_evidence", requirement: "Used when standard criteria do not readily apply...", criteria: [...] }, // FOR P-1A ONLY: { pathType: "itinerary_evaluation", requirement: "Detailed itinerary of competitions/events...", criteria: [...] }, // FOR P-1B ONLY: { pathType: "entertainment_group_evaluation", requirement: "75% rule and sustained relationship...", criteria: [...] } ], thresholds: {...}, finalMeritsAdjustmentFactors: [...] }; VISA-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS P-1A (Internationally Recognized Athletes) - NO COMPARABLE EVIDENCE Evaluation Paths: Major Award Path (if applicable) Standard Criteria Path (must meet 2+ of specified criteria) Itinerary Evaluation Path (REQUIRED - unique to P-1A) Standard Criteria (from regulations): Significant participation in major U.S. sports league International competition with national team Significant U.S. college competition Written statement from sports federation official Written statement from sports media/expert International ranking (if applicable to sport) Significant honors or awards Unique Itinerary Requirements: Event distinguished reputation assessment Competition level verification Completeness and clarity scoring Alignment with athlete profile Contract/invitation verification P-1B (Entertainment Groups) - NO COMPARABLE EVIDENCE Evaluation Paths: Standard Criteria Path (must meet specific requirements) Entertainment Group Evaluation Path (REQUIRED - unique to P-1B) Standard Criteria: International recognition for sustained period 75% member rule (75% of members for at least 1 year) Statement from foreign labor organization Evidence of international acclaim Critical reviews or published materials Evidence of commercial success Significant performances for distinguished organizations Unique Group Requirements: Sustained and substantial relationship verification Individual vs. group reputation assessment Replacement member provisions Integral member determinations O-1B (Arts/Entertainment) - HAS COMPARABLE EVIDENCE Evaluation Paths: Major Award Path (Oscar, Grammy, etc.) Standard Criteria Path (meet 3+ criteria) Comparable Evidence Path Standard Criteria: Lead/starring participant in distinguished productions Critical reviews establishing recognition Lead/starring role for distinguished organizations Record of major commercial or critically acclaimed successes Significant recognition from organizations/critics/experts High salary compared to others in field Comparable Evidence Examples: Digital/streaming metrics for non-traditional media Social media influence with measurable impact Crowdfunding success for independent artists Non-traditional venue performances with significance EB-1A (Extraordinary Ability) - HAS COMPARABLE EVIDENCE Evaluation Paths: Major Award Path Standard Criteria Path (meet 3+ of 10 criteria) Comparable Evidence Path Standard Criteria (10 total): Lesser nationally/internationally recognized prizes Membership requiring outstanding achievements Published material about person Judging work of others Original contributions of major significance Scholarly articles Artistic exhibitions/showcases Leading/critical role High salary Commercial success in performing arts Comparable Evidence Considerations: Must explain why each standard criterion doesn't apply Must show comparable evidence is of similar caliber Subject to same final merits determination EVIDENCE WEIGHTING BY VISA TYPE For P-1A and P-1B (No Comparable Evidence): Required documentation: Mark as "Required" Primary evidence: 20-25% Supporting evidence: 15-20% Contextual evidence: 10-15% Expert verification: 10-15% Media coverage: 10-15% Additional documentation: 5-10% For O-1B and EB-1A (With Comparable Evidence): Apply stricter reductions as in O-1A template: Required documentation: Mark as "Required" Primary evidence: 15-20% (reduced from 20-25%) Supporting evidence: 10-15% (reduced from 15-20%) Basic evidence: 5% (reduced from 10%) Expert letters: 5-10% (reduced from 15-20%) Media coverage: 5-10% (reduced from 15-20%) THRESHOLD CALIBRATION BY VISA TYPE P-1A Thresholds (Lower bar than O-1): Strong Approval: 65-125 points Likely Approval: 50-64 points Borderline Case: 40-49 points Likely Denial: 0-39 points P-1B Thresholds (Entertainment groups): Strong Approval: 65-125 points Likely Approval: 50-64 points Borderline Case: 40-49 points Likely Denial: 0-39 points O-1B Thresholds (Arts - similar to O-1A): Standard Evidence: Strong Approval: 60-225 points Likely Approval: 40-59 points Borderline Case: 15-39 points Likely Denial: 0-14 points Comparable Evidence: Strong Approval: 55-225 points Likely Approval: 35-54 points Borderline Case: 10-34 points Likely Denial: 0-9 points EB-1A Thresholds (Highest bar): Standard Evidence: Strong Approval: 85-250 points Likely Approval: 70-84 points Borderline Case: 55-69 points Likely Denial: 0-54 points Comparable Evidence: Strong Approval: 80-250 points Likely Approval: 65-79 points Borderline Case: 50-64 points Likely Denial: 0-49 points CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION RULES P-1A and P-1B: DO NOT include comparable evidence sections O-1B and EB-1A: MUST include complete comparable evidence paths EB-1A: Include all 10 criteria (not 8 like O-1) P-1A: MUST include itinerary evaluation as separate path P-1B: MUST include 75% rule evaluation mechanisms All visas: Include webhook integration structure QUALITY CONTROL CHECKLIST BY VISA TYPE For P-1A and P-1B: NO comparable evidence path included Alternative evaluation paths included (itinerary/group) Sport/entertainment-specific criteria Lower point thresholds than O-1 All regulatory criteria covered For O-1B and EB-1A: Complete comparable evidence path Explanation requirements for comparable evidence All standard criteria have comparable alternatives Appropriate threshold adjustments EB-1A has 10 criteria (not 8) DELIVERABLE VALIDATION Before submitting each blueprint, verify: Does it match the O-1A template structure (with appropriate modifications)? Is comparable evidence correctly included/excluded based on visa type? Are all visa-specific unique requirements included? Are thresholds appropriately calibrated for difficulty level? Does P-1A include itinerary evaluation? Does P-1B include 75% rule evaluation? Does EB-1A have all 10 criteria? Are the point ranges appropriate for each visa's standards? FINAL CRITICAL NOTE The presence or absence of comparable evidence is NOT optional - it is determined by USCIS regulations: P-1A and P-1B: These visas have NO regulatory provision for comparable evidence O-1A, O-1B, and EB-1A: These visas explicitly allow comparable evidence when standard criteria don't readily apply This distinction must be perfectly implemented in each blueprint.RetrySSP-1A (Internationally Recognized Athletes) - NO COMPARABLE EVIDENCE Evaluation Paths: 1. Major Award Path (if applicable) - if they are signed with a major league - at least 6 teams and over 10,000,000 annual revenue with the leage - there is no major award path - redo this prompt with this much detail as previously done - do the prompt and exucition again with these updatesEditRefined visa criteria based on critical user correction.The user is providing important corrections about the P-1A visa: There is NO major award path for P-1A If athletes are signed with a major league (defined as at least 6 teams and over $10,000,000 annual revenue), this is not a major award but rather one of the standard criteria I need to revise the master prompt with this correction and ensure all details are as comprehensive as the previous version. The P-1A doesn't have an automatic qualification path like some other visas do with major awards. Let me create a revised, highly detailed prompt that incorporates this correction and maintains the same level of detail as before.MASTER PROMPT INSTRUCTIONS FOR VISA SCORING BLUEPRINT PROJECT - REVISED PROJECT OBJECTIVE Create comprehensive, production-ready scoring blueprints for P-1A, P-1B, O-1B, and EB-1A visas that match the exact quality, structure, and detail level of the O-1A template document, with precise understanding of each visa's regulatory framework and evaluation paths.
