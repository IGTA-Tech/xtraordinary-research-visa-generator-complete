You currently employ two individuals.  In your\npetition you claim that you seek to employ the beneficiary as a \"world class combat sports athlete\" for\na period of three years at the salary of $250,000 per year.\nThe initial record did not establish the necessary requirements, including:\nCopies of written contracts between the petitioner and the alien beneficiary or, if there is no\nwritten contract, a summary of the terms of the oral agreement under which the alien(s) will be\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\nVermont Service Center \nIOE8060416147\nVSCI129VSCPPD0000358470091 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

The\nfact that you have submitted evidence of either a qualifying award or evidence relating to at least three\nof the applicable criteria as required by the regulation does not necessarily establish that the\nbeneficiary is eligible for O-1 classification.  The evidence submitted must establish that the\nbeneficiary qualifies as an individual of extraordinary ability.  See 59 Fed. Reg. 41818, 41820 (Aug.\n15, 1994) (“The evidence submitted by the petitioner is not the standard for the classification, but\nmerely the mechanism to establish whether the standard has been met.”). \nThe standard for the classification relates to the definition of the classification. The totality of the\nevidence must establish that the beneficiary has sustained national or international acclaim and is one\nof the small percentage who have arisen to the very top of the beneficiary's field. \nThe record does not establish the necessary requirements, including:\nAt the time of filing, the record included a summary of the terms of the oral agreement under\nwhich the alien will be employed as required by 8 CFR section 214.2(o)(2)(ii)(B);\nAn explanation of the nature of the events or activities, the beginning and ending dates for the\nevents or activities; and a copy of any itinerary for the events or activities as required by 8 CFR\nsection 214.2(o)(2)(ii)(C);\nA written advisory opinion(s) from the appropriate consulting entity or entities as required by 8\nCFR section 214.2(o)(2)(ii)(D); and\nAt the time of filing, you satisfied all of the conditions for filing as a: \nU.S. agent filing the petition on behalf of a foreign employer as defined in 8 CFR\n214.2(o)(2)(iv)(E)(3).\nAll deficiencies in the record will be further discussed below. \nGeneral Requirements\nVSCI129VSCPPD0000358470092 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nTitle 8 CFR 214.2(o)(2)(ii) identifies the general documentary evidence required to accompany a\npetition filed for O aliens as:\n(A) The evidence specified in the particular section for the classification;\n(B) Copies of any written contracts between the petitioner and the alien beneficiary or, if there\nis no written contract, a summary of the terms of the oral agreement under which the alien will\nbe employed;\n(C) An explanation of the nature of the events or activities, the beginning and ending dates for\nthe events or activities; and a copy of any itinerary for the events or activities; and\n(D) A written advisory opinion(s) from the appropriate consulting entity or entities.\nContracts\nThe first issue is whether you have satisfied the contract requirement.\nTitle 8 CFR 214.2(o)(2)(ii)(B) requires copies of any written contracts between the petitioner and the\nalien beneficiary or, if there is no written contract, a summary of the terms of the oral agreement under\nwhich the alien(s) will be employed.\nIn addition,  8 CFR 103.2(b)(1) states:\n(b) Evidence and processing\n(1) Demonstrating eligibility. An applicant or petitioner must establish that he or she is\neligible for the requested benefit at the time of filing the benefit request and must\ncontinue to be eligible through adjudication. Each benefit request must be properly\ncompleted and filed with all initial evidence required by applicable regulations and other\nUSCIS instructions. Any evidence submitted in connection with a benefit request is\nincorporated into and considered part of the request.\nUSCIS recognized in the RFE your submission of a letter of support as well as a \"Petitioner and\nTalent Agreement\" and between you and the beneficiary. However, the RFE notified you that the\ndocument includes conflicting information relating to the relationship between you, the beneficiary,\nand the employers who seek to hire the beneficiary for services rendered.\nFor example, in your petition support letter you state:\nThe Petitioner is acting on behalf of the Beneficiary, a foreign-based self-employed\nprofessional athlete and entrepreneur, to coordinate a variety of extraordinary engagements\nacross the United States. These engagements include participation in high-profile mixed martial\narts competitions, promotional appearances, media productions, sponsorship activations, and\nleadership initiatives through his role with the Professional Fighters League (PFL).\nThe RFE explained that the scenario described above is indicative of a U.S. agent representing the\nbeneficiary and his multiple employers. Additionally, your petition support letter states:\n2. Service of Process:\nVSCI129VSCPPD0000358470093 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nAccept service of process on behalf of the Beneficiary, and if applicable, for foreign employers\nor multiple employers included in the petition. Authorization documentation from all relevant\nparties is included in this petition.\nYour petition support letter also states:\nThe Petitioner acts as a U.S. Agent representing a self-employed foreign employer. This\nstructure requires the Petitioner to coordinate the Beneficiary’s activities and ensure compliance\nwith U.S. labor and immigration regulations. Authorization documentation from the foreign\nemployer is included in this petition.\nThe RFE explained that this statement indicates that a foreign employer may be involved in the\nbeneficiary's employment.\nThe RFE notified you that the \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" also provides conflicting statements\nwith regard to the terms and conditions of the beneficiary's employment. For example, the agreement\nindicates that the beneficiary is self-employed athlete and will:\nCompete in self [negotiated] world class events in the United States .\nHe will serve as an actor and self produce self [documentaries].\nServe as combat coach and [training[ center building for MMA.\nActivations for Sponsorships and other appearance related activities.\nThe RFE explained that, regardless of the capacity in which you are filing the instant petition, the\nevidence submitted with your petition did not satisfy the contract requirement.  The \"Petition and\nTalent Agreement\" between you and the beneficiary is insufficient to satisfy the contract requirement\nbecause this document does not sufficiently detail the terms and conditions under which the\nbeneficiary will be employed.\nFor example, the initially submitted \"Petition and Talent Agreement\" indicates the beneficiary will\nearn $250,000 per year \"in wages and competition earnings\". You also stated that these wages are\n\"subject to such adjustments as may be determined by applicable parties from time to time\".\n Therefore, the beneficiary's initially claimed annual earnings appeared to be speculative. The initial\nrecord did not contain contracts, establishing the wage offered to the beneficiary and details regarding\nthe terms and conditions between the beneficiary and the \"applicable parties\" who seek to hire the\nbeneficiary for services rendered.\nIn response to the RFE you provided a \"US Agent Representation Agreement\" between the newly\nidentified foreign employer, Boza Investment SARL, and you, the U.S. agent.  This agreement signed\nby both parties and the beneficiary on September 4, 2025, describes the employment relationship\nbetween the beneficiary and Boza Investment.  The agreement states that the employment period is\nSeptember 1, 2025 through August 31, 2026, \"with automatic renewal provisions\".  \nRegarding the beneficiary's compensation for his employment, the \"US Agent Representation\nAgreement\" states the beneficiary will now earn a \"minimum $30,000 USD per month ($360,000\nannually), paid via direct wire transfer from Foreign Employer's business accounts\".\nHowever, the evidence submitted with your response to the RFE does not establish that, at the time\nyou filed the instant petition, your petition included a contract detailing the actual terms and conditions\nof the beneficiary's employment during the requested validity period.  For example, the RFE response\nidentifies a new foreign employer and the \"US Agent Representation Agreement\" includes a\nsignificant change in the beneficiary's compensation from $250,000 per year to $360,000 per year. The\nVSCI129VSCPPD0000358470094 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nsignificant change in the beneficiary's compensation from $250,000 per year to $360,000 per year. The\ninconsistencies between the two agreements call into question the veracity of the information\nprovided \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" that was submitted with your petition.\nIn addition, in your initial petition you requested an employment start date of July 1, 2025, and, as\nexplained above, the \"US Agent Representation Agreement\" indicates an employment start of\nSeptember 1, 2025, and the \"US Agent Representation Agreement\" was signed by all parties on\nSeptember 4, 2025. Both dates indicate the \"US Agent Representation Agreement\" was entered into\nafter the date you filed the instant petition and after the issuance of the RFE.  \nAs explained above, in 8 CFR 103.2(b) a  petitioner must establish eligibility for the requested benefit\nat the time of filing the benefit request.  Further, in is noted in Matter of Michelin Tire Corp., 17 I&N\nDec. 248 (Comm.1978),  the the petitioner must establish eligibility at the time of filing the visa\npetition.  A visa petition may not be approved at a future date after the petitioner or beneficiary\nbecomes eligible under a new set of facts. \nMoreover, the newly claim employment relationship between the beneficiary and his foreign\nemployer, Boza Investment, as well as the changes in wages earned by the beneficiary appears to be a\nmaterial change in the the terms and conditions of the beneficiary's employment.  A petitioner may not\nmake material corrections to his petition in an effort to make a deficient petition conform to USCIS\nrequirements. Matter of Izummi, 22 I&N Dec. 169 (Comm. 1998).\nConsidering the discussion above, the record does not establish the terms and conditions of the\nbeneficiary's employment as claimed in the \"US Agent Representation Agreement\" existed at the time\nyou filed the instant petition.  Further, the evidence of record does not establish that the information\ncontained in the Petitioner and Talent Agreement are an accurate representation of the beneficiary's\nemployment during the requested validity period. As such, your petition does not satisfy the\nrequirements of 8 CFR 214.2(o)(2)(ii)(B).\nEvent\nThe second issue in this matter is where the evidence of record establishes the nature of the event or\nactivities in which the beneficiary will participate. \nTitle 8 CFR 214.2(o)(2)(ii)(C) An explanation of the nature of the events or activities, the beginning\nand ending dates for the events or activities; and a copy of any itinerary for the events or activities.\nPetitions seeking O nonimmigrant classification must include an explanation of the competition, event,\nor performance in which the beneficiary will participate.  An event means an activity such as a\nscientific project, conference, convention, lecture series, academic year, or engagement during the\nrequested validity period.  If you are filing for an O-1 athlete, a copy of the contract may satisfy this\nrequirement.\nThe RFE notified you that description you submitted with your petition was insufficient to establish\nthis requirement. In the \"Petition and Talent Agreement\" your provide the following explanation of the\nbeneficiary's employment activities:\nCompete in self [negotiated] world class events in the United States.\nHe will serve as an actor and self produce self [documentaries].\nServe as combat coach and [training[ center building for MMA.\nActivations for Sponsorships and other appearance related activities.\nThe RFE notified you that this explanation was incomplete and vague. The initial record did not\nVSCI129VSCPPD0000358470095 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nThe RFE notified you that this explanation was incomplete and vague. The initial record did not\ncontain an itinerary of engagements or contract that include the names and addresses of the entities\nwith whom the beneficiary is contracted to perform the services; and the names and addresses of the\nestablishments, venues, and/or locations where the services will be performed.\nThe RFE explained that itineraries of events and/or engagements must include the names and\naddresses of the entities with whom the beneficiary is contracted to perform the services; and the\nnames and addresses of the establishments, venues, or locations where the services will be performed.\nIn response to the RFE you submitted a \"Comprehensive Business Operations Itinerary\".  This\nitinerary provided the following overview of the beneficiary's employment activities activities:\nI. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - FOREIGN EMPLOYER BUSINESS DIRECTIVES\nPrimary Business Directive\nForeign Employer hereby directs Beneficiary to establish and operate a revolutionary\nAl-enhanced combat sports business operations center in Las Vegas, Nevada, serving as the\nprimary hub for Foreign Employer's U.S. market expansion activities.

To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nwithin the United States as part of Foreign Employer's international business expansion:\nA. Elite Competition and Athletic Performance Foreign\nEmployer directs Beneficiary to: \nParticipate in premier mixed martial arts competitions and exhibitions\nEngage with elite training facilities and performance centers\nRepresent Foreign Employer's brand through competitive excellence\nExecute promotional and media activities surrounding competitions\nB. Strategic Partnership Development\nForeign Employer directs Beneficiary to:\nServe as brand ambassador for Professional Fighters League (PFL) and other elite\norganizations\nExecute corporate partnership activations on behalf of Foreign Employer\nDevelop strategic relationships with U.S. combat sports entities\nRepresent Foreign Employer in high-level business negotiations\nC. Media and Content Development\nForeign Employer directs Beneficiary to:\nParticipate in television, streaming, and broadcast productions\nCreate content supporting Foreign Employer's international brand development\nEngage with media entities for promotional and educational purposes\nDevelop documentary and educational content for international distribution\nD. Athletic Leadership and Development\nForeign Employer directs Beneficiary to:\nConduct coaching and mentorship programs representing Foreign Employer's\nmethodologies\nLead seminars and instructional clinics showcasing Foreign Employer's training systems\nConsult on facility development projects for international expansion\nMentor emerging athletes as part of Foreign Employer's development initiatives\nE. Business Development and Market Expansion\nForeign Employer directs Beneficiary to:\nExecute strategic planning for Foreign Employer's U.S. market entry\nEngage with potential partners and investors on Foreign Employer's behalf\nDevelop facility and infrastructure projects supporting international expansion\nRepresent Foreign Employer in industry conferences and business development activities\nAgain, the \"US Agent Representation Agreement\" does not sufficiently identify the names and\naddresses of the locations where the services will be performed.\nFurther, the employment activities described in the \"Comprehensive Business Operations Itinerary\" are\nVSCI129VSCPPD0000358470097 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\ninconsistent with the employment activities listed in the \"US Agent Representation Agreement\". \nSpecifically, the \"US Agent Representation Agreement\" states the beneficiary will be competing in\ncombat sports events, acting in documentaries, coaching other athletes, and representing brands\nwhereas the \"Comprehensive Business Operations Itinerary\" indicates the beneficiary will be\nestablishing an AI-enhance combat sports training facility.\nWhen there are inconsistencies in the record, it is the responsibility of the petitioner to resolve any\nsuch inconsistencies by using independent, objective evidence.  Any attempt to explain or reconcile\nsuch inconsistencies will not suffice unless the petitioner submits competent objective evidence\npointing to where the truth lies.  See Matter of Ho, 19 I&N Dec. 582 (BIA 1988).  The record does not\ncontain independent, objection evidence that would overcome the inconsistencies found in\nthe \"Comprehensive Business Operations Itinerary\" and \"US Agent Representation Agreement\" and to\nestablish the nature of the beneficiary's event as a \"world class combat sports athlete\". \nConsidering the discussion above, the nature of the events and activities of the beneficiary's\nemployment as required by 8 CFR 214.2(o)(2)(ii)(C) have not been established.  \nConsultation\nThe third issue is whether your petition includes an advisory opinion from a U.S. peer group, labor\norganization, and/or management organization in the area of the beneficiary’s ability.\nTitle 8 CFR 214.2(o)(5)(i) states in pertinent part: \n(A) Consultation with an appropriate U.S. peer group (which could include a person or persons\nwith expertise in the field), labor, and/or management organization regarding the nature of the\nwork to be done and the alien's qualifications is mandatory before a petition for an O-1 or O-2\nclassification can be approved.\n(B) Except as provided in paragraph (o)(5)(i)(E) of this section, evidence of consultation shall\nbe in the form of a written advisory opinion from a peer group (which could include a person or\npersons with expertise in the field), labor, and/or management organization.\n(C) Except as provided in paragraph (o)(5)(i)(E) of this section, the petitioner shall obtain a\nwritten advisory opinion from a peer group (which could include a person or persons with\nexpertise in the field), labor, and/or management organization with expertise in the specific field\ninvolved.  The advisory opinion shall be submitted along with the petition when the petition is\nfiled.  The advisory opinion should set forth a specific statement of facts which supports the\nconclusion reached in the opinion.  Advisory opinions must be submitted in writing and must\nbe signed by an authorized official of the group or organization.\n(D) Except as provided in paragraph (o)(5)(i)(E) and (G) of this section, written evidence of\nconsultation shall be included in the record of every approved O petition.  Consultations are\nadvisory and are not binding on the Service.         \n...\n(F) In routine processing case where the petition is accompanied by a written opinion from a\npeer group, but the peer group is not a labor organization, the Director will forward a copy of\npetition and all supporting documentation to the national office of the appropriate labor\norganization within 5 days of receipt of the petition...\nVSCI129VSCPPD0000358470098 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\n(G) In those cases where it is established by the petitioner that an appropriate peer group,\nincluding a labor organization, does not exist, the Service shall render a decision on the\nevidence of record. \nPetitions seeking O-1A nonimmigrant classification must include a written advisory opinion from a\nU.S. peer group, labor organization, and/or management organization in the area of the beneficiary’s\nability.  The U.S. peer group may include a person or persons with expertise in the field.\nIn your petition, you indicated on the O and P Classifications Supplement and/or in the record that an\nappropriate labor organization does not exist for this position.  \nThe RFE notified you that a review of the record found no letter from a U.S. peer group in the area of\nthe beneficiary’s ability or documentation that an appropriate peer group does not exist.\nIn response to the RFE you provided statement explaining why there is no appropriate labor\norganization for a World Class Combat Sports Athlete\".  While there does not appear to be a labor\norganization for combat sports, you did not submit a letter from a U.S. peer group or evidence that a\nU.S. peer group does not exist in combat sports.\nTherefore, your petition does not satisfy 8 CFR 214.2(o)(5)(i) because your petition is not\naccompanied by an advisory opinion from a U.S. peer group and the record does not contain\ndocumentary evidence that a U.S. peer group does not exist in combat sports.\nAgent Petitioner\nThe fourth issue is that you have not satisfied the requirements for an agent as petitioner.\nTitle 8 CFR 214.2(o)(2)(i) provides a general discussion about the filing of O petitions and states in\npertinent part: \n...An O-1 or O-2 petition may only be filed by a United States employer, a United States agent,\nor a foreign employer through a United States agent.  For purposes of paragraph (o) of this\nsection, a foreign employer is any employer who is not amenable to service of process in the\nUnited States.  A foreign employer may not directly petition for an O nonimmigrant alien but\ninstead must use the services of a United States agent to file a petition for an O nonimmigrant\nalien.  A United States agent petitioning on behalf of a foreign employer must be authorized to\nfile the petition, and to accept services of process in the United States in proceedings under\nsection 274A of the Act, on behalf of the foreign employer... \nFurthermore, 8 CFR 214.2(o)(2)(iv)(E) discusses agents as petitioners and states: \nA United States agent may file a petition in cases involving workers who are traditionally\nself-employed or workers who use agents to arrange short-term employment on their behalf\nwith numerous employers, and in cases where a foreign employer authorizes the agent to act in\nits behalf.  A United States agent may be:  The actual employer of the beneficiary, the\nrepresentative of both the employer and the beneficiary; or, a person or entity authorized by the\nemployer to act for, or in place of, the employer as its agent.  A petition filed by an agent is\nsubject to the following conditions: \nAn agent performing the function of an employer must provide the contractual\nagreement between the agent and the beneficiary which specifies the wage offered and\n1.\nVSCI129VSCPPD0000358470099 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nthe other terms and conditions of employment of the beneficiary.\nA person or company in business as an agent may file the petition involving multiple\nemployers as the representative of both the employers and the beneficiary, if supporting\ndocumentation includes a complete itinerary of the event or events.  The itinerary must\nspecify the dates of each service or engagement, the names and addresses of the actual\nemployers, and the names and addresses of the establishments, venues, or locations\nwhere the services will be performed.  A contract between the employers and the\nbeneficiary is required.  The burden is on the agent to explain the terms and conditions\nof the employment and to provide any required documentation.\n2.\nA foreign employer who, through a United States agent, files a petition for an O\nnonimmigrant alien is responsible for complying with all of the employer sanctions\nprovisions of section 274A of the Act and 8 CFR Part 274a.\n3.\nFinally, 8 CFR 103.2(b)(1) states:\n(b) Evidence and processing\n(1) Demonstrating eligibility. An applicant or petitioner must establish that he or she is\neligible for the requested benefit at the time of filing the benefit request and must\ncontinue to be eligible through adjudication. Each benefit request must be properly\ncompleted and filed with all initial evidence required by applicable regulations and other\nUSCIS instructions. Any evidence submitted in connection with a benefit request is\nincorporated into and considered part of the request.\nAgent for Foreign Employer\nA foreign employer who, through a U.S. agent, files a petition for a O nonimmigrant alien is\nresponsible for complying with all of the employer sanctions provisions of section 274A of the Act\nand 8 CFR part 274a, to include the actual commencement of employment of an employee for wages\nor other remuneration.\nIn support of your petition you submitted a \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" between the beneficiary\nand petitioner which states:\nRecitals\nWhereas, the Petitioner is serving in the following roles) as indicated with an X:\n_ Direct Employer\n_ US Agent Functioning as Employer\n_ US Agent for Foreign Employer\n_ US Agent for Multiple Employers\nX US Agent for Foreign Employer who is Self-Employed\nAt the outset, the RFE notified you that filing this petition as a \"US Agent for Foreign Employer who\nis Self-Employed\" is not an agent relationship that is described by 8 CFR 214.2(p)(2)(iv)(E).  Rather,\na U.S. agent \"may file a petition in cases involving workers who are traditionally self-employed or\nworkers who use agents to arrange short-term employment on their behalf with numerous employers,\nand in cases where a foreign employer authorizes the agent to act on its behalf\".\nVSCI129VSCPPD00003584700910 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nand in cases where a foreign employer authorizes the agent to act on its behalf\".\nAs stated above in the discussion about contracts, the \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" includes\nconflicting information relating to the relationship between the agent petitioner, the beneficiary and the\nemployers who seek to hire the beneficiary for services rendered.\nWhile it appeared in your initial filing that the beneficiary would be a self-employed athlete, the initial\nrecord did not establish the U.S. agent capacity in which you filed this petition. In your petition\nsupport letter you state:\nThe Petitioner is acting on behalf of the Beneficiary, a foreign-based self-employed\nprofessional athlete and entrepreneur, to coordinate a variety of extraordinary engagements\nacross the United States. These engagements include participation in high-profile mixed martial\narts competitions, promotional appearances, media productions, sponsorship activations, and\nleadership initiatives through his role with the Professional Fighters League (PFL).\nMoreover, your submitted agreement lists the following \"Self-Employment Activities\" the beneficiary\nwill be engaging in during the requested validity period:\nCompete in self [negotiated] world class events in the United States .\nHe will serve as an actor and self produce self [documentaries].\nServe as combat coach and [training[ center building for MMA.\nActivations for Sponsorships and other appearance related activities.\nIn your petition support letter you also stated that you are a U.S. agent and seek to \"accept service of\nprocess on behalf of the Beneficiary and Foreign Employer if applicable\".  However, the initial\npetition did not identify any foreign employers who have contracted the beneficiary's services as a\ncombat sports athlete.  Moreover, you did not initially submit an agreement between the beneficiary\nand a foreign employer outlining the terms and conditions of the beneficiary's employment with the\nforeign employer such as how the beneficiary will be paid, etc. For example, the  \"Petitioner and\nTalent Agreement\" claims the beneficiary will be compensated at a rate of $250,000.00 USD\nannually.  However, the initial record did not include documentation relating to how or by whom the\nbeneficiary will be paid.\nAs such, the initial evidence of record did not specify the wage offered by a foreign employer and\nother terms of employment, did not establish employment was secured by the foreign employer, and\ndid not establish that you are authorized to file the instant petition and to accept service of process on\nbehalf of a foreign employer. Therefore, initial record did not establish that you are a U.S. agent filing\non behalf of a foreign employer.\nIn response to the RFE you now claim that that the beneficiary will be employed by the foreign\nemployer and provided a \"US Agent Representation Agreement\" between the newly identified foreign\nemployer, Boza Investment, and you, the U.S. agent.  This agreement signed by both parties and the\nbeneficiary on September 4, 2025, describes the employment relationship between the beneficiary and\nBoza Investment.  The agreement states that the employment period is September 1, 2025 through\nAugust 31, 2026, \"with automatic renewal provisions\".  \nUSCIS acknowledges that you provided corporate documentation for Boza Investment showing that\nthe beneficiary is the sole shareholder/associate of the company and was registered in April 26, 2024;\nhowever, there appears to be a significant changes in the \"US Agent Representation Agreement\" that\ncalls into question whether Boza Investment was the intended employer in your initial petition. \nVSCI129VSCPPD00003584700911 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nFor example, regarding the beneficiary's compensation for his employment, the \"US Agent\nRepresentation Agreement\" states the beneficiary will now earn a \"minimum $30,000 USD per month\n($360,000 annually), paid via direct wire transfer from Foreign Employer's business accounts\".  This\nwage amount is a significant change in the beneficiary's compensation from $250,000 per year to\n$360,000 per year. \nIn addition, as explained above. your initial petition requested an employment start date of July 1,\n2025, and the newly submitted \"US Agent Representation Agreement\" indicates an employment start\nof September 1, 2025.  Moreover, the \"US Agent Representation Agreement\" was signed by all parties\non September 4, 2025.  Both dates indicate the \"US Agent Representation Agreement\" was entered\ninto after the date you filed the instant petition and after the issuance of the RFE. \nAs explained above, in 8 CFR 103.2(b) a  petitioner must establish eligibility for the requested benefit\nat the time of filing the benefit request.  Further, it is noted in Matter of Michelin Tire Corp. the the\npetitioner must establish eligibility at the time of filing the visa petition.  A visa petition may not be\napproved at a future date after the petitioner or beneficiary becomes eligible under a new set of facts. \nMoreover, the newly claim employment relationship between the beneficiary and his foreign\nemployer, Boza Investment, as well as the changes in wages earned by the beneficiary appears to be a\nmaterial change in the the terms and conditions of the beneficiary's employment.  A petitioner may not\nmake material corrections to his petition in an effort to make a deficient petition conform to USCIS\nrequirements. see Matter of Izummi.\nConsidering the discussion above, the evidence of record does not establish that you satisfied the\nconditions for a U.S. agent filing on behalf of a foreign employer as defined in 8 CFR\n214.2(p)(2)(iv)(E)(3).\nConclusion\nIn view of the above, the record does not establish:\nThe record does not establish the necessary requirements, including:\nAt the time of filing, the record included a summary of the terms of the oral agreement under\nwhich the alien will be employed as required by 8 CFR section 214.2(o)(2)(ii)(B);\nAn explanation of the nature of the events or activities, the beginning and ending dates for the\nevents or activities; and a copy of any itinerary for the events or activities as required by 8 CFR\nsection 214.2(o)(2)(ii)(C);\nA written advisory opinion(s) from the appropriate consulting entity or entities as required by 8\nCFR section 214.2(o)(2)(ii)(D); and\nAt the time of filing, you satisfied all of the conditions for filing as a: \nU.S. agent filing the petition on behalf of a foreign employer as defined in 8 CFR\n214.2(o)(2)(iv)(E)(3).\nAs such, the evidence of record does not establish that the beneficiary qualifies as an O-1A\nnonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(O)(i) of the Act. \nTherefore, your petition is denied. \nIf applicable, the portion of the petition requesting an extension of stay or change of status for the\nbeneficiary is now being denied as the nonimmigrant visa petition filed on the beneficiary's behalf has\nVSCI129VSCPPD00003584700912 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

The individual must have sustained national or international acclaim.  The\nindividual's achievements must be in the field of expertise and show that the individual is one of a\nsmall percentage who has risen to the very top of the field.  The individual must be coming to the\nUnited States to continue work in the individual's area of extraordinary ability.\nPursuant to the preponderance of evidence standard, USCIS will examine each piece of evidence for\nrelevance, probative value, and credibility, both individually and within the context of the totality of\nevidence, to determine whether the fact to be proven is probably true.  USCIS comprehensively\nreviews the entire body of evidence before rendering a final determination of eligibility.  Upon review\nof the evidence you submitted in the initial filing, the record contains insufficient documentation to\nestablish the beneficiary meets the regulatory requirements for the O-1A classification. \nTo process your petition and determine if the beneficiary is eligible, additional information is\nrequired.  This request provides suggested evidence that you may submit to satisfy each requested\nitem.  You may:\nSubmit one, some, or all of these items;\nSubmit none of the suggested items and instead submit other evidence to satisfy the request;\nExplain how the evidence in the record already establishes eligibility; and/or\nRequest a decision based on the record. \nNote, however, that you are responsible for providing evidence that best shows that you and the parties\nto this petition meet all requirements.  Evidence must show that all parties were eligible for the\nrequested benefit when you filed Form I-129.\nNote: When submitting additional evidence, please indicate to which individual criterion it applies.  If\nyou choose to submit comparable evidence in lieu of one or more of the criteria below, please indicate\nwhy the criteria you wish to replace do not apply to the occupation.  \nAdditionally, when submitting articles, internet abstracts, and other documentation (excluding\ntestimonial letters) that includes the beneficiary’s name, please highlight the beneficiary’s name.  \nPlease submit evidence that is the most current and is presented in an orderly fashion. Illegible\nphotocopies will not be accepted as valid evidence.\nRequest for Translations\nAll foreign language documents must have a complete English translation to establish eligibility.  This\nincludes any documents you submit in response to this Request for Evidence.  In order for USCIS to\nconsider this evidence, you must submit English language translations for each document.

If a written contract does not exist, you may\nsubmit a detailed summary of the terms of the oral agreement between the beneficiary and either the\npetitioner or the employer.  \nThe contract you submitted is insufficient.\nUSCIS recognizes your submission of a letter of support as well as a \"Petitioner and Talent\nAgreement\" and between you and the beneficiary. However, this document includes conflicting\ninformation relating to the relationship between you, the beneficiary, and the employers who seek to\nhire the beneficiary for services rendered.\nFor example, in your petition support letter you state:\nThe Petitioner is acting on behalf of the Beneficiary, a foreign-based self-employed\nprofessional athlete and entrepreneur, to coordinate a variety of extraordinary engagements\nacross the United States. These engagements include participation in high-profile mixed martial\narts competitions, promotional appearances, media productions, sponsorship activations, and\nleadership initiatives through his role with the Professional Fighters League (PFL).\nThe above the scenario described is indicative of a U.S. agent representing the beneficiary and his\nmultiple employers.\nAdditionally, your petition support letter states:\n2. Service of Process:\nAccept service of process on behalf of the Beneficiary, and if applicable, for foreign employers\nor multiple employers included in the petition. Authorization documentation from all relevant\nparties is included in this petition.\nYou also state:\nThe Petitioner acts as a U.S. Agent representing a self-employed foreign employer. This\nstructure requires the Petitioner to coordinate the Beneficiary’s activities and ensure compliance\nwith U.S. labor and immigration regulations. Authorization documentation from the foreign\nemployer is included in this petition.\nThis statement indicates that a foreign employer may be involved in the beneficiary's employment. \nVSCI129VSCPPI0000351951303 of 10www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nThis statement indicates that a foreign employer may be involved in the beneficiary's employment. \nThe \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" also provides conflicting statements with regard to the terms\nand conditions of the beneficiary's employment. For example, the agreement indicates that the\nbeneficiary is self-employed athlete and will:\nCompete in self [negotiated] world class events in the United States .\nHe will serve as an actor and self produce self [documentaries].\nServe as combat coach and [training[ center building for MMA. \nActivations for Sponsorships and other appearance related activities.\nRegardless of the capacity in which you are filing the instant petition, the evidence provided does not\nsatisfy the contract requirement.\nThe \"Petition and Talent Agreement\" between you and the beneficiary is insufficient to satisfy the\ncontract requirement because this document does not sufficiently detail the terms and conditions under\nwhich the beneficiary will be employed.\nFurther, while the contract indicates the beneficiary will earn $250,000 per year \"in wages and\ncompetition earnings\",  you also state that these wages are \"subject to such adjustments as may be\ndetermined by applicable parties from time to time\".  Therefore, the beneficiary's claimed annual\nearnings appear to be speculative. The record does not contain contracts, establishing the wage offered\nto the beneficiary and details regarding the terms and conditions between the beneficiary and the\n\"applicable parties\" who seek to hire the beneficiary for services rendered.\nPlease provide a statement clarifying your relationship with the beneficiary and provide the names of\nthe entities that will be compensating the beneficiary for services rendered.\nYou may still submit evidence to satisfy the requirements specified below. \nIf the information you provide does not support approval of the full validity period requested, the\nperiod granted will be based on the evidence provided, which may be a limited validity period. \nWritten contracts, or the summary of the terms of an oral agreement, must specify the terms and\nconditions of the employment or services.  They must: \nSpecify the wage offered and explain the terms and conditions under which the beneficiary will\nperform these services; and\nDetail any additional services provided. \nAgents\nPetitions for O-1A nonimmigrants may be filed by a: \nU.S. employer;\nU.S. agent; or\nA foreign employer through a U.S. agent. \nU.S. Agents\nIt appears that you are a U.S. agent.

A United States agent may be: The actual employer of the beneficiary, the\nrepresentative of both the employer and the beneficiary; or, a person or entity authorized by the\nemployer to act for, or in place of, the employer as its agent. A petition filed by an agent is\nsubject to the following conditions:\n(1) An agent performing the function of an employer must provide the contractual\nagreement between the agent and the beneficiary which specifies the wage offered and\nthe other terms and conditions of employment of the beneficiary.\n(2) A person or company in business as an agent may file the petition involving multiple\nemployers as the representative of both the employers and the beneficiary, if supporting\ndocumentation includes a complete itinerary of the event or events. The itinerary must\nspecify the dates of each service or engagement, the names and addresses of the actual\nemployers, and the names and addresses of the establishments, venues, or locations\nwhere the services will be performed. A contract between the employers and the\nbeneficiary is required. The burden is on the agent to explain the terms and conditions of\nthe employment and to provide any required documentation.\n(3) A foreign employer who, through a United States agent, files a petition for an O\nVSCI129VSCPPI0000351951305 of 10www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

Rather, a U.S. agent \"may file a\npetition in cases involving workers who are traditionally self-employed or workers who use agents to\narrange short-term employment on their behalf with numerous employers, and in cases where a\nforeign employer authorizes the agent to act on its behalf\". \nAs stated above, the \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" includes conflicting information relating to the\nrelationship between the agent petitioner, the beneficiary and the employers who seek to hire the\nbeneficiary for services rendered.\nWhile it appears the beneficiary is a self-employed athlete, the record does not establish the U.S. agent\ncapacity in which you are filing this petition. Further, the record does not establish that you satisfy the\nconditions for filing the instant petition as a U.S. agent representing the beneficiary and one or more\nemployers. \nIn your petition support letter:\nThe Petitioner is acting on behalf of the Beneficiary, a foreign-based self-employed\nprofessional athlete and entrepreneur, to coordinate a variety of extraordinary engagements\nacross the United States.

USCIS\nacknowledges that the contract indicates the beneficiary will earn $250,000 per year \"in wages and\ncompetition earnings\"; however, you also state that these wages are \"subject to such adjustments as\nmay be determined by applicable parties form time to time\".  Therefore, the beneficiary's claimed\nannual earnings appear to be speculative. Further, the agreement does not specify the entity(ies)\nresponsible for compensating the beneficiary.  \nWhile USCIS acknowledges that the agent regulations do not include a prevailing wage requirement\nand no particular wage structure is required, the regulations do specifically state the actual wage must\nbe specified. The record does not include contracts between the beneficiary and his employer that\nestablish the wage offered or fee structure which specifies where, when and from whom the\nbeneficiary will be paid.\nAs stated above, an agent representing the beneficiary and one or more employers is required to\nsubmit a complete itinerary of services or engagements which specifies the dates of each service or\nengagement, the names and addresses of the actual employers, the names and addresses of the\nestablishment, venues, or locations where the services will be performed.\nUSCIS recognizes your description of the beneficiary's \"Self-Employment Activities\" listing the\nbeneficiary's proposed employment activities during the requested validity period.

You must\nsubmit evidence that shows you are authorized to: \nFile the petition; and\nAccept service of process in the United States on behalf of the foreign\nemployer.                                                                                                                                               \nThe evidence you submitted is insufficient.   \nA foreign employer who, through a U.S. agent, files a petition for a O nonimmigrant alien is\nresponsible for complying with all of the employer sanctions provisions of section 274A of the Act\nand 8 CFR part 274a, to include the actual commencement of employment of an employee for wages\nor other remuneration.\nWhile you claim that the beneficiary will be employed by a foreign employer, as explained above, you\nhave included statements and supporting evidence directly contradicting that assertion.\nVSCI129VSCPPI0000351951307 of 10www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nhave included statements and supporting evidence directly contradicting that assertion.\nIn your petition support letter you state that you are a U.S. agent and seek to \"accept service of process\non behalf of the Beneficiary and Foreign Employer if applicable\".  However, the petition does not\nidentify any foreign employers who have contracted the beneficiary's services as a combat sports\nathlete.  Moreover, you submitted no agreement between the beneficiary and a foreign employer\noutlining the terms and conditions of the beneficiary's employment with the foreign employer such as\nhow the beneficiary will be paid, etc. For example, your representation agreement claims the\nbeneficiary will be compensated at a rate of $250,000.00 USD annually, however, the record does not\ninclude contractual documentation relating to how or by whom the beneficiary will be paid. \nAs such, the evidence of record does not specify the wage offered by a foreign employer and other\nterms of employment, does not establish employment has been secured by the foreign employer, and\ndoes not establish that you are authorized to file the instant petition and to accept service of process on\nbehalf of the employer. Therefore, you have not established that you are a U.S. agent filing on behalf\nof a foreign employer.\nYou may still submit evidence to satisfy this requirement. \nNature of the Event or Engagement\nPetitions seeking O nonimmigrant classification must include an explanation of the competition, event,\nor performance in which the beneficiary will participate.  An event means an activity such as a\nscientific project, conference, convention, lecture series, academic year, or engagement during the\nrequested validity period.  If you are filing for an O-1 athlete, a copy of the contract may satisfy this\nrequirement. \nThe description you submitted is insufficient.

Petitions for P\nnonimmigrant aliens shall be accompanied by the following:\nThe evidence specified in the specific section of this part for the classification;A.\nCopies of any written contracts between the petitioner and the alien beneficiary or, if\nthere is no written contract, a summary of the terms of the oral agreement under\nwhich the alien(s) will be employed;\nB.\nAn explanation of the nature of the events or activities, the beginning and ending\ndates for the events or activities, and a copy of any itinerary for the events or\nactivities; and\nC.\nA written consultation from a labor organization.D.\nIn addition, 8 CFR section 214.2(p)(4)(ii)(A) states: \nGeneral.

A\npetition for an athletic team must be accompanied by evidence that the team as a unit has\nachieved international recognition in the sport.  Each member of the team is accorded P-1\nclassification based on the international reputation of the team.  A petition for an athlete who\nwill compete individually or as a member of a U.S. team must be accompanied by evidence\nthat the athlete has achieved international recognition in the sport based on his or her\nreputation.  A petition for a P-1 athlete or athletic team shall include: \nA tendered contract with a major United States sports league or team, or a tendered\ncontract in an individual sport commensurate with international recognition in that\nsport, if such contracts are normally executed in the sport, and\n1.\nDocumentation of at least two of the following:2.\nEvidence of having participated to a significant extent in a prior season with a\nmajor United States sports league;\ni.\nEvidence of having participated in international competition with a national\nteam;\nii.\nEvidence of having participated to a significant extent in a prior season for a\nU.S. college or university in intercollegiate competition;\niii.\nA written statement from an official of the governing body of the sport which\ndetails how the alien or team is internationally recognized;\niv.\nA written statement from a member of the sports media or a recognized expert\nin the sport which details how the alien or team is internationally recognized;\nv.\nEvidence that the individual or team is ranked if the sport has international\nrankings; or\nvi.\nEvidence that the alien or team has received a significant honor or award in the\nsport\nvii.\nLastly, 8 CFR 214.2(p)(2)(iv)(E) states: \nAgents as petitioners.  A United States agent may file a petition in cases involving workers who\nare traditionally self-employed or workers who use agents to arrange short-term employment\non their behalf with numerous employers, and in cases where a foreign employer authorizes the\nagent to act on its behalf.  A United States agent may be: the actual employer of the\nbeneficiary; the representative of both the employer and the beneficiary; or, a person or entity\nauthorized by the employer to act for, or in place of, the employer as its agent.  A petition filed\nby an United States agent is subject to the following conditions: \n(1) An agent performing the function of an employer must specify the wage offered and\nthe other terms and conditions of employment by contractual agreement with the\nbeneficiary or beneficiaries. The agent/employer must also provide an itinerary of\ndefinite employment and information on any other services planned for the period of\ntime requested.\n(2) A person or company in business as an agent may file the P petition involving\nmultiple employers as the representative of both the employers and the beneficiary or\nbeneficiaries if the supporting documentation includes a complete itinerary of services or\nengagements. The itinerary shall specify the dates of each service or engagement, the\nnames and addresses of the actual employers, the names and addresses of the\nestablishment, venues, or locations where the services will be performed. In questionable\ncases, a contract between the employer(s) and the beneficiary or beneficiaries may be\nrequired. The burden is on the agent to explain the terms and conditions of the\nemployment and to provide any required documentation.\nVSCI129VSCPPD0000355954273 of 18www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

You seek\nto represent the beneficiary as a \"World Class Bodybuilder/Fitness Competitor\" for a period of three\n(3) years at an unknown salary amount.\nTo establish the beneficiary's eligibility for the requested nonimmigrant classification, you provided\nthe following evidence with the filing of the petition: \n \nForm I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker;\nForm I-129, O and P Classifications Supplement to Form I-129;\nPetitioner Support Letter;\nPrior approval notices;\nProductions/Events supporting documentation;\nMedia articles and supporting documentation;\nRepresentation agreement between beneficiary and petitioner;\nItinerary; and\nBeneficiary’s identity documents.\nThe initial record did not establish the beneficiary qualifies for P-1 nonimmigrant classification. \nSpecifically,  the initial record did not establish the following:\nYou have satisfied all the conditions for an agent petitioner as described in, 8 CFR\n214.2(p)(2)(iv)(E);\nThe beneficiary is coming to the United States solely and temporarily to perform as an athlete\nwith respect to a specific athletic competition or production as required by INA §\n214(c)(4)(A)(ii);\nThe beneficiary is coming to the United States to participate in an athletic competition which\nhas a distinguished reputation and which requires participation of an athlete or athletic team that\nhas an international reputation as required in 8 CFR 214.2(p)(4)(ii)(A);\nThe beneficiary has a tendered contract with a major United States sports league or team, or a\ntendered contract in an individual sport commensurate with international recognition in that\nsport, if such contracts are normally executed in the sport as required in 8 CFR\n214.2(p)(4)(ii)(B)(1); and\nThat the beneficiary meets the evidentiary requirements for an internationally recognized\nathlete or athletic team as described in 8 CFR § 214.2(p)(4)(ii)(B).\nTherefore, on June 6, 2025, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued a request for\nVSCI129VSCPPD0000355954274 of 18www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nevidence (RFE) requesting additional documentation to overcome the deficiencies in the record.   \nOn August 18, 2025, USCIS received your response.  The record does not establish the beneficiary\nqualifies for the P-1A classification.  All deficiencies in the record will be further discussed below.\nPrior Approvals\nUSCIS acknowledges that the beneficiary has previously been granted the benefit being sought, that\nyou are requesting to extend your petition and have requested USCIS grant deference to prior\napprovals when evaluating the beneficiary's eligibility for the benefit being sought.  When\nadjudicating a subsequent petition or application involving the same parties and the same underlying\nfacts, where appropriate, USCIS will generally defer to its prior determination of eligibility for the\nparticular nonimmigrant classification sought.\nHowever, each petition filing is a separate proceeding with a separate record.  Despite any previously\napproved petitions, the petitioner bears the burden to establish eligibility for each petition that it\nsubmits, and an immigration benefit cannot be granted when the petitioner fails to meet its burden of\nproof for the petition it files, including an extension petition. See INA § 291.  USCIS is not required to\napprove petitions where eligibility has not been demonstrated, merely because of prior approvals\nwhich may have been erroneous.  Matter of Church Scientology International, 19 I&N Dec. 593, 597\n(Comm'r 1988).\nUSCIS will not defer to prior approvals where:\nThere was a material error with regard to the previous approval(s);  1.\nThere has been a material change in circumstances or eligibility requirements; or  2.\nThere is new material information that adversely impacts the petitioner’s, beneficiary’s, or\napplicant’s eligibility.\n3.\nUSCIS recognizes your petition includes statements and supporting evidence referencing the\nbeneficiary’s prior approvals for the requested classification.  USCIS has reviewed this instant petition\nfiled on behalf of the beneficiary.  There has been a material change in circumstances or eligibility\nrequirements.  On Form I-129 Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, your requested filing\nclassification indicates there is a \"Change of Employer\".  Therefore, there has been a material change\nin circumstances or eligibility requirements. \nAdditionally, you have not established the requirements for agent petitioners as described under 8\nCFR 214.2(p)(2)(iv)(E).\nAs such, there is new material information that adversely impacts the petitioner’s, beneficiaries’, or\napplicant’s eligibility.  Additionally, if the same or similar evidence was submitted with the\nbeneficiaries’ prior approvals, there was a material error with regard to the previous approval(s).\nAs stated above, despite any previously approved petitions, the petitioner bears the burden to establish\neligibility for each petition that it submits, and an immigration benefit cannot be granted when the\npetitioner fails to meet its burden of proof for the petition it files, including an extension petition.\nTherefore, this petition must be supported by its own documentation and will be adjudicated based\nupon its own merits.  A more detailed discussion about the deficiencies will be discussed below. \nUSCIS will not defer to its prior approval in adjudicating this petition.\nAgents and Sponsoring Organizations\nPetitions for P-1 nonimmigrants may be filed by: \nVSCI129VSCPPD0000355954275 of 18www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

You must provide evidence to establish the\nrelationship between you and the relevant parties, showing that you are: \nPerforming the function of an employer;\nRepresenting the beneficiary and multiple employers with whom the beneficiary is contracted\nto work;\nRepresenting both the beneficiary and the employer; or\nRepresenting a foreign employer.\n Agents performing the function of an employer must submit:\nA written contract, or if a written contract does not exist, the summary of the terms of the oral\nagreement that: \nSpecifies the wage offered and other terms of employment; and\nDetails any additional services provided.\nAn itinerary of definite employment and information on any other services planned for the\nperiod of time requested. \nAgents representing both the beneficiary and one or more employers must submit:\nEvidence that the agent is authorized to act as an agent on behalf of the beneficiary and all of\nthe entities with whom the beneficiary is contracted to perform the services;\nA complete itinerary of services or engagements that: \nSpecifies the dates of each service or engagement;\nProvides the names and addresses of the entities with whom the beneficiary is contracted\nto perform the services; and\nProvides the names and addresses of the establishments, venues or locations where the\nservices will actually be performed. \nForeign Employers\nA U.S. agent filing for a foreign employer must submit evidence that shows: \nYou are authorized to file the petition; and\nYou are authorized to accept service of process on behalf of the employer. \nThe evidence you submitted is insufficient.\nVSCI129VSCPPD0000355954276 of 18www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

A United States agent may file a petition in cases involving workers\nwho are traditionally self-employed or workers who use agents to arrange short-term\nemployment on their behalf with numerous employers, and in cases where a foreign employer\nauthorizes the agent to act on its behalf. A United States agent may be: the actual employer of\nthe beneficiary; the representative of both the employer and the beneficiary; or, a person or\nentity authorized by the employer to act for, or in place of, the employer as its agent. A petition\nfiled by an United States agent is subject to the following conditions:\n(1) An agent performing the function of an employer must specify the wage offered and\nthe other terms and conditions of employment by contractual agreement with the\nbeneficiary or beneficiaries. The agent/employer must also provide an itinerary of\ndefinite employment and information on any other services planned for the period of\ntime requested.\n(2) A person or company in business as an agent may file the P petition involving\nmultiple employers as the representative of both the employers and the beneficiary or\nbeneficiaries if the supporting documentation includes a complete itinerary of services or\nengagements. The itinerary shall specify the dates of each service or engagement, the\nnames and addresses of the actual employers, the names and addresses of the\nestablishment, venues, or locations where the services will be performed. In questionable\ncases, a contract between the employer(s) and the beneficiary or beneficiaries may be\nrequired. The burden is on the agent to explain the terms and conditions of the\nemployment and to provide any required documentation.\n(3) A foreign employer who, through a United States agent, files a petition for a P\nnonimmigrant alien is responsible for complying with all of the employer sanctions\nprovisions of section 274A of the Act and 8 CFR part 274a.\nUSCIS recognizes your submission of a \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" between the beneficiary\nand petitioner with your initial filing.\nHowever, this document includes conflicting information relating to the relationship between the agent\npetitioner, the beneficiary and the employers who seek to hire the beneficiary for services rendered.\nSpecifically, your included agreement states the following:\nRecitals\nWhereas, the Petitioner is serving in the following roles) as indicated with an X:\n_ Direct Employer\n_ US Agent Functioning as Employer\n_ US Agent for Foreign Employer\nX US Agent for Multiple Employers\nX US Agent for Foreign Employer who is Self-Employed\nAs such, your included documentation appears to assert that the relationship between petitioner and\nagent are both an agent representing both the beneficiary and one or more employers and also an agent\nfiling this petition on behalf of a \"foreign employer who is self employed\".\nAdditionally, the agreement between you and the beneficiary submitted with your initial filing states\nthe following:\nVSCI129VSCPPD0000355954277 of 18www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nThe applicable Authorization(s) from third-parties to this agreement are included with this\npetition that indicated permission for the petitioner to file this petition and for the petitioner to\nreceive service of process.\nMoreover, your submitted agreement lists the following \"Multiple Employer Activities\" the\nbeneficiary will be engaging in during the requested validity period:\nMultiple Employer Activities\nActivities performed for multiple employers, coordinated and overseen by the Petitioner to\nensure compliance with immigration regulations.\nRepresentation in sponsorship collaborations with natural supplement, apparel, and\nwellness\ncompanies.\nBrand ambassadorship roles involving multiple commercial sponsors coordinated by\nPetitioner.\nService as a consultant, spokesperson, or judge for IFBB Natural Division initiatives.    \nMentoring rising athletes in training, recovery, and longevity strategies           \nEstablishment and development of online brand presence.\nYou indicate the above list relates to \"Activities performed for multiple employers, coordinated and\noverseen by the Petitioner\".  \nMoreover, you submitted an \"Updated Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" with your RFE response. \nThis document removes the check mark next to US Agent for Multiple Employers and specifically\nindicates that you are filing as a \"US Agent for Foreign Employer who is Self-Employed\".  \nPlease note, filing as a \"US Agent for Foreign Employer who is Self-Employed\" is not one of the\nfiling types as specified by regulation above.  Furthermore, you have not established the regulatory\nrequirements for agents representing the beneficiary and the employers who seek to hire him and also\nagents representing a foreign employer.  \nThis document states the following:\nAs a self-employed individual, the Beneficiary shall be directly compensated by clients,\nsponsors, event organizers, or other contracting third parties. The Petitioner shall not be\nresponsible for payment of wages or benefits, but shall serve to facilitate legal access to the\nU.S. market for engagements related to the Beneficiary’s field of extraordinary ability.\nYour statements indicates that \"the Beneficiary shall be directly compensated by clients, sponsors,\nevent organizers, or other contracting third parties\".  This does not indicate that the beneficiary is a\nself-employed foreign employer. \nMoreover, your updated agreement also states the following relating to the petitioner's role:\nThe Petitioner shall serve as the U.S. agent authorized to oversee the Beneficiary’s U.S.-based\nengagements, coordinating scheduling, communications with third parties, and immigration\ncompliance. The Petitioner does not assume the role of employer but exercises control and\nlogistical authority over the terms and conditions of the Beneficiary’s participation in U.S.\nactivities, in accordance with the Matter of Walsh and Pollard and USCIS's O-1/P-1 regulatory\nframework for agent-based filings.\nVSCI129VSCPPD0000355954278 of 18www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nBased on your statements, it appears that control over the beneficiary’s employment rests largely with\nthe contracting \"clients, sponsors, event organizers, or other contracting third parties\".  Furthermore,\nthe petitioner's contractually agreed upon role is to \" oversee the Beneficiary’s U.S.-based\nengagements, coordinating scheduling, communications with third parties, and immigration\ncompliance\".  Correspondingly, the prevalence of such agreements and your statements directly\ncontradict supporting evidence suggesting that you would retain a level of control indicative of a US\nAgent representing a foreign employer.  \nTherefore, the record does not establish that the agent directed path included in your statements is\ncommon to the weight lifting profession.  Contrary to your included statements, it appears that the\nagent directed path simply describes the role of a manager.  Based on the included evidence and\npublicly available information, the agent directed path appears to involve the athlete having a manager\nwho helps them negotiate with the \"clients, sponsors, event organizers, or other contracting third\nparties\" who will actually be employing the beneficiary. \nFurthermore, based on the submitted evidence agreements between the athlete and \"clients, sponsors,\nevent organizers, or other contracting third parties\" appears to be the industry standard.  As such,\nrather than an agent representing a foreign employer who is self employed, you appear to be\nrepresenting the beneficiary and multiple \"clients, sponsors, event organizers, or other contracting\nthird parties\" that seek to enter into promotional agreements with the beneficiary. \nAs stated above, an agent representing the beneficiary and one or more employers is required to\nsubmit a complete itinerary of services or engagements which specifies the dates of each service or\nengagement, the names and addresses of the actual employers, the names and addresses of the\nestablishment, venues, or locations where the services will be performed.  \nUSCIS recognizes your submission of an itinerary listing the beneficiary's proposed bodybuilding\ncompetitions.  However, you indicate the beneficiary will be engaged in a variety of activities outside\nof competitions including activities where the beneficiary is employed by third party employers. \nSpecifically, the updated agreement submitted with your RFE indicates the beneficiary will be\nengaged in the following activities during the requested validity period:\nSponsorship campaigns\nCoaching and mentorship programs\nSpeaking engagements and athlete panels\nMedia appearances and branding activations\nThe included itinerary does not list any of the referenced sponsorship, ambassadorship, mentoring,\ncoaching and mentorship programs, speaking engagements and athlete panels, media appearances and\nbranding activations, etc., activities as listed on the included agreement.  Furthermore, the itinerary\ndoes not indicate who the beneficiary's employers will be when engaging in those activities.  As such,\nthe itinerary you submitted is insufficient to meet the regulatory requirements for agents representing\nthe beneficiary and the beneficiary's employers. \nAdditionally, the included itinerary states the following:\nFor each competition listed in this itinerary, the following supporting documentation should be\ncompiled:\nOfficial Invitation/Registration: Formal documentation confirming acceptance or invitation to\ncompete\n1.\nEvent Promotional Materials: Official flyers, posters, or digital media showing the international2.\nVSCI129VSCPPD0000355954279 of 18www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

The burden is on the agent to explain the terms and\nconditions of the employment and to provide any required documentation.\nAs indicated above, you have provided conflicting statements and supporting documentation relating\nto the relationship between the petitioner and beneficiary.  Moreover, your statements indicate that the\nindustry standard is to receive official invites and sign contracts with the listed competitions in order to\nparticipate.

As such, you have not satisfied\nthis requirement. \nYou were notified of this discrepancy in the RFE sent to you.\nYour response removed the \"Multiple Employer Activities\" section and the \"Self-Employment\nActivities\" sections of your employment agreement.  As such it appears you made a material change to\nyour petition to conform to USCIS requirements.\nIn Matter of Izummi, 22 I&N Dec. 169 (Comm. 1998), it was established that a petitioner may not\nmake material corrections to his petition in an effort to make a deficient petition conform to USCIS\nrequirements.\nFurthermore, you included an updated agreement with your RFE which lists the following activities\nfor the beneficiary:\nThe Petitioner shall act as the U.S. Agent for the foreign self-employed Beneficiary,\ncoordinating and facilitating professional activities in the United States, including but not\nlimited to:\nAthletic competitions and exhibitions\nSponsorship campaigns\nCoaching and mentorship programs\nSpeaking engagements and athlete panels\nMedia appearances and branding activations\nA detailed itinerary of scheduled and prospective engagements will be submitted as a separate\nexhibit in the petition and may be updated throughout the term of this Agreement.\nYour itinerary does not include any description or detail relating to the sponsorship campaigns,\ncoaching and mentorship programs, speaking engagements and athlete panels and media appearances\nand branding activations referenced in your included agreement.  Your submitted documentation lists a\nvariety of engagements that are not for the purpose of performing in a specific athletic competition as\nan athlete or coach.  As such, you have not satisfied this requirement. \nYou have not submitted sufficient evidence the beneficiary is coming to the United States solely for\nthe purpose of performing in a specific athletic competition.  Accordingly, you have not established\nthat the beneficiary satisfies this requirement. \nInternationally Recognized Level of Competition\nThe evidence in the record must demonstrate that the beneficiary (as an individual athlete or as a\nmember of an athletic team) is coming to the United States to participate in an athletic competition or\nleague that has a distinguished reputation and which requires participation of an athlete or athletic\nVSCI129VSCPPD00003559542712 of 18www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

However, while these documents provide a general overview of the events, they do not\nsufficiently establish how and/or why these events could be considered an athletic competition or\nleague that has a distinguished reputation and which requires  participation of an athlete or athletic\nteam that has an international reputation.  \nFor example, many of the included documents indicates that anyone paying a fee can participate in the\nevents.  They do not specifically articulate how and/or why these events could be considered an\nathletic competition or league that has a distinguished reputation and which requires  participation of\nan athlete or athletic team that has an international reputation.  \nFurthermore, some of the events have various prequalifying conditions.  For example, to participate in\nthe 2025 NPC U.S.A Bodybuilding championships, the following eligibility requirements have to be\nmet:\nYOU MUST BE 18 YEARS OF AGE BY JULY 25, 2025.1.\nYOU MUST BE A REGISTERED 2024 ATHLETE WITH THE NATIONAL PHYSIQUE\nCOMMITTEE.\n2.\nYOU MUST BE A U.S. CITIZEN OR USA RESIDENCY (Residing in the USA for 4 months\nprior to the contest date, or must be a full-time student in the USA with proof of a College\nissued student ID, or work visa with Social Security card) - NO EXCEPTIONS. ONLY VALID\nPROOF OF CITIZENSHIP IS: US Birth Certificate, US Passport, Naturalization Certificate,\nU.S. Green Card or visa showing student or work for a minimum of 4 months.\n3.\nYOU MUST HAVE COMPETED AND OBTAINED ONE OF THE FOLLOWING\nPLACEMENTS IN AN NPC SANCTIONED EVENT:\n4.\nYou competed in 2024, or 2025 NPC Nationals, NPC USA, Team Universe, IFBB North\nAmerican Championships, Jr. National or Jr. USA Bodybuilding Championships, Teen\nCollegiate or Masters Nationals Bodybuilding Championships and placed top 5.\nYou competed since January 1, 2024 and placed top 2 in your height/weight group in\nOPEN/UNLIMITED class in an area/district level designated as a National Qualifier.\nYou did not provide evidence that the beneficiary competed in the qualifying events and has been\ninvited to participate in this competition.\nAs such, the submitted evidence does not satisfy this requirement. \n You have not submitted sufficient evidence to establish the beneficiary is coming to the United States\nto participate in an athletic competition or league that has a distinguished reputation and which requires\nparticipation of an athlete or athletic team that has an international reputation.  Accordingly, you have\nnot established that the beneficiary satisfies this requirement.  \nTendered Contract\nIn accordance with 8 CFR 214.2(p)(4)(ii), the evidence in the record must include a tendered contract\nwith a major United States sports league or team, or a tendered contract in an individual sport\ncommensurate with international recognition in that sport, if such contracts are normally executed in\nthe sport.\nAs stated above, the included itinerary states the following:\nVSCI129VSCPPD00003559542713 of 18www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nAs stated above, the included itinerary states the following:\nFor each competition listed in this itinerary, the following supporting documentation should be\ncompiled:\nOfficial Invitation/Registration: Formal documentation confirming acceptance or invitation to\ncompete\n1.\nEvent Promotional Materials: Official flyers, posters, or digital media showing the international\nprestige of the event\n2.\nCompetition History: Results from previous years demonstrating international participation3.\nMedia Coverage: Publications highlighting the international significance of the events4.\nGoverning Body Documentation: Letters or statements from IFBB Pro League or NPC officials\nconfirming the international recognition of each competition\n5.\nContract/Agreement: Documentation of agreements to participate in specified competitions6.\nThis itinerary and the supporting evidence demonstrate that the athlete’s participation is required at\ninternationally recognized competitions, satisfying a key requirement for P-1A visa classification.\nYour statements indicate that to participate in the listed competitions on the included itinerary, an\n\"Official Invitation/Registration: Formal documentation confirming acceptance or invitation to\ncompete\" is required to compete and also there is a \"Contract/Agreement: Documentation of\nagreements to participate in specified competitions\" which is signed prior to participation. \nYou submitted no contracts with the organizing bodies or official invites to any of the listed\ncompetitions.  \nThe record does not include a tendered contract with a major United States sports league or team, or a\ntendered contract in an individual sport commensurate with international recognition in that sport, if\nsuch contracts are normally executed in the sport.\nBeneficiary Qualifications\nYou indicate the beneficiary qualifies for P-1 non-immigrant status.  As defined in statute and\nregulation, a beneficiary may qualify for the P-1A classification as an internationally recognized\nathlete, a professional athlete, an amateur athlete, or as a professional or amateur skater who performs\nindividually or as part of a group in a theatrical ice skating production.  \nAs you do not claim the beneficiary qualifies as a professional athlete, an amateur athlete, or a\nprofessional or amateur skater who performs individually or as a part of a group in a theatrical ice\nskating production these grounds of eligibility will not be discussed further in this denial.\nRequirements for Athletes and Teams\nYou indicate that the beneficiary or team has international recognition.  In this situation, the P-1A\nclassification requires an athlete to have an internationally recognized reputation.  Alternatively, an\nathlete must be a member of a foreign team that is internationally recognized in the sport.  The athlete\nor team must be coming to the United States solely to participate in competitions that have\ndistinguished reputations.  Petitions for:\n1.  Individual athletes, competing as individuals or on a U.S. team, must show the\ninternational recognition is based on their individual accomplishments and that the services to\nVSCI129VSCPPD00003559542714 of 18www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

A team must show that it has achieved international recognition and that the services to be\nperformed require an internationally recognized athletic team.  Each member of the team then\nreceives P-1A classification based on the team’s recognition.\nP1A International Athlete Discussion\nInternational Athlete\nBased on the evidence provided, you are seeking to qualify the beneficiary as an internationally\nrecognized athlete.  The international athlete must perform as an athlete, individually or as part of a\ngroup or team, at an internationally recognized level of performance.  You must establish the\nbeneficiary or team’s eligibility under at least two of the seven criteria set forth in 8 CFR\n214.2(p)(4)(ii)(B)(2).  Each criterion will be discussed separately. \nFirst Criterion\nTo meet the first criterion, at 8 CFR 214.2(p)(4)(ii)(B)(2)(i), you must submit evidence the beneficiary\nparticipated to a significant extent in a prior season with a major United States sports league. \nYour support letter states the following regarding the beneficiary’s eligibility under this criterion:\nJeremiah Elie clearly meets the regulatory requirement under 8 CFR 21 4.2(p)(4)(ii)(B)(2)(i)\nthrough significant participation in major United States-based international sporting events.\nSpecifically, he has prominently participated in internationally recognized competitions within\nthe United States, including the prestigious Arnold Amateur USA, which consistently attracts\ntop-tier global competitors.\nMoreover, your letter also states:\nThe Beneficiary, Jeremiah Elie, has previously been approved under the P-1A visa\nclassification and has consistently maintained continuous activity in professional bodybuilding\nand fitness competitions at the highest international levels. While professional bodybuilding\ndoes not follow a traditional team sports league structure like the NFL or NBA, it is\nprominently recognized and structured through major sanctioned international competitions\nunder renowned governing bodies such as the International Federation of Bodybuilding and\nFitness (IFBB).\nPer your own statements, \"bodybuilding does not follow a traditional team sports league structure like\nthe NFL or NBA\".  To meet the plain language of this requirement, you must submit\nevidence showing participation in a prior season with a major U.S. sports league.  While you submitted\nevidence that the beneficiary has participated in various bodybuilding competitions, the submitted\nevidence does not establish that the beneficiary participated in a prior season with a major U.S. sports\nleague.  \nYou have not submitted sufficient evidence that the beneficiary participated to a significant extent in a\nprior season with a major United States sports league.  Accordingly, you have not established that the\nbeneficiary meets this criterion.\nSecond Criterion\nTo meet the second criterion, at 8 CFR 214.2(p)(4)(ii)(B)(2)(ii), you must submit evidence the\nbeneficiary participated in international competition with a national team. \nYour included support letter states the following:\nVSCI129VSCPPD00003559542715 of 18www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nMr. Jeremiah Elie clearly satisfies the regulatory requirement under 8 CFR\n214.2(p)(4)(ii)(B)(2)(ii), having represented Canada on multiple occasions at elite international\nbodybuilding competitions. His participation as part of Canada’s national team at these\nprestigious global events provides compelling evidence of his extraordinary athletic abilities\nand international recognition.\nUSCIS recognizes your submission of various documents listing the results of competitions in which\nthe beneficiary participated.  While these documents state the country of origin of each competitor, the\nsubmitted evidence does not indicate that the beneficiary was on a \"national team\".  As such, the\nsubmitted evidence does not meet the plain language of this criterion. \nYou have not submitted sufficient evidence that the beneficiary participated in international\ncompetition with a national team.  Accordingly, you have not established that the beneficiary meets\nthis criterion.\nThird Criterion\nTo meet the third criterion, at 8 CFR 214.2(p)(4)(ii)(B)(2)(iii), you must submit evidence the\nbeneficiary participated to a significant extent in a prior season for a United States college or\nuniversity in intercollegiate competition. \nYou do not claim that the beneficiary meets this criterion, and the record contains no evidence relevant\nto this criterion.\nFourth Criterion\nTo meet the fourth criterion, at 8 CFR 214.2(p)(4)(ii)(B)(2)(iv), you must submit a written statement\nfrom an official of the governing body of the sport which details how the beneficiary or team is\ninternationally recognized. \nYou do not claim that the beneficiary meets this criterion, and the record contains no evidence relevant\nto this criterion.\nFifth Criterion\nTo meet the fifth criterion, at 8 CFR 214.2(p)(4)(ii)(B)(2)(v), you must submit a written statement\nfrom a member of the sports media or a recognized expert in the sport which details how the\nbeneficiary or team is internationally recognized. \nThe evidence you submitted is insufficient. \nUSCIS recognizes your submission of a letter from Eren Legend, IFBB Pro, with your RFE response,\nwhich states the following:\nIn addition to competing, I’ve spent years coaching high-level athletes, mentoring emerging\ncompetitors, and serving as an active spokesperson for the sport. These roles have given me the\nopportunity to work with and observe many of the industry’s best across both Canada and the\nUnited States — and that includes Jeremiah Elie.\nI’m writing this letter in full support of Jeremiah’s visa petition to continue competing in the\nU.S. under the IFBB Pro League. I’ve known Jeremiah professionally for many years, and I can\nconfidently say he is one of the most driven, respected, and capable athletes in our sport today.\nWe’ve crossed paths multiple times over the years — at shows, in prep, and at national events\n— and his commitment to excellence has always stood out. His work ethic, discipline, and\npresence within the industry are undeniable. What makes Jeremiah exceptional is that he’s not\nVSCI129VSCPPD00003559542716 of 18www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\njust an athlete — he’s a true ambassador for bodybuilding. Even when faced with setbacks,\nincluding a significant spinal injury, he stayed consistent, focused, and engaged with the\ncommunity.\nNow that he’s back in full training and committed to competing over the next several years, I\nhave no doubt that his return will make a meaningful impact He embodies the standards of\nprofessionalism, visibility, and international recognition that define a true IFBB Pro.\nWhile this letter is authored by a recognized expert in the sport, and gives a general description of the\nbeneficiary's skills and abilities, this letter does not specifically indicate how and/or why the\nbeneficiary is internationally recognized in their sport. \nYou have not submitted a written statement from a member of the sports media or a recognized expert\nin the sport which details how the beneficiary or team is internationally recognized.  Accordingly, you\nhave not established that the beneficiary meets this criterion.\nSixth Criterion\nTo meet the sixth criterion, at 8 CFR 214.2(p)(4)(ii)(B)(2)(vi), you must submit evidence that the\nindividual or team is ranked if the sport has international rankings. \nYour included support letter states the following:\nJeremiah Elie meets and exceeds the requirement under 8 CFR 21 4.2(p)(4)(ii)(B)(2)(vi),\nclearly demonstrated through his official international rankings achieved in prominent\nbodybuilding competitions sanctioned by the International Federation of Bodybuilding and\nFitness (IFBB). These competitions are highly regarded globally, providing formal rankings\nand placements of international competitors.\nUSCIS recognizes your submission of various documents showing the beneficiary placed at various\nbodybuilding competitions.  However, you provided no evidence that the beneficiary holds an\ninternational ranking in the respective sport.  Furthermore, you submitted no evidence that an\ninternational ranking is available for the sport of bodybuilding.  Simply placing in various\ncompetitions does not satisfy the plain language of this criterion. \nYou have not submitted evidence the individual or team is ranked in the sport’s international\nrankings.  Accordingly, you have not established that the beneficiary meets this criterion.\nSeventh Criterion\nTo meet the seventh criterion, at 8 CFR 214.2(p)(4)(ii)(B)(2)(vii), you must submit evidence that the\nbeneficiary or team has received a significant honor or award in the sport. \nt appears that the beneficiary meets this criterion.\nConclusion\nIn view of the above, you have not established that the beneficiary qualifies for classification under \nthe section 101(a)(15)(P)(i)(a) of the Act.  Therefore, your petition is denied.\nIf applicable, the portion of the petition requesting an extension of stay or change of status for the\nbeneficiary is now being denied as the nonimmigrant visa petition filed on the beneficiary's behalf has\nbeen denied.\nThis decision may leave the beneficiary without lawful immigration status.  If the beneficiary is\npresent in the United States in violation of the law, he or she is required to depart immediately. \nVSCI129VSCPPD00003559542717 of 18www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

You are seeking to employ or sponsor\nthe beneficiary as \"World Class Bodybuilder/Fitness Competitor\". \nThe P-1A classification may be granted to internationally recognized athletes based on their\nreputations and achievements as individuals.  It may also be granted to groups of two or more\nindividuals that function as a unit and are internationally recognized as teams.  Beneficiaries must be\ncoming to the United States to perform services requiring an internationally recognized athlete or team\nat a specific athletic competition, as an athlete or team.\nTo process your petition and determine if the beneficiary is eligible, additional information is\nrequired.  This request provides suggested evidence that you may submit to satisfy each requested\nitem.  You may: \nsubmit one, some, or all of these items;\nsubmit none of the suggested items and instead submit other evidence to satisfy the request;\nexplain how the evidence in the record already establishes eligibility; and/or\nrequest a decision based on the record. \nPrior Approvals\nUSCIS acknowledges that the beneficiary has previously been granted the benefit being sought, that\nyou are requesting to extend your petition and have requested USCIS grant deference to prior\napprovals when evaluating the beneficiary's eligibility for the benefit being sought.  When\nadjudicating a subsequent petition or application involving the same parties and the same underlying\nfacts, where appropriate, USCIS will generally defer to its prior determination of eligibility for the\nparticular nonimmigrant classification sought.\nHowever, each petition filing is a separate proceeding with a separate record.  Despite any previously\napproved petitions, the petitioner bears the burden to establish eligibility for each petition that it\nsubmits, and an immigration benefit cannot be granted when the petitioner fails to meet its burden of\nproof for the petition it files, including an extension petition. See INA § 291.  USCIS is not required to\napprove petitions where eligibility has not been demonstrated, merely because of prior approvals\nwhich may have been erroneous.  Matter of Church Scientology International, 19 I&N Dec. 593, 597\n(Comm'r 1988).\nUSCIS will not defer to prior approvals where:\nThere was a material error with regard to the previous approval(s);  1.\nThere has been a material change in circumstances or eligibility requirements; or  2.\nThere is new material information that adversely impacts the petitioner’s, beneficiary’s, or\napplicant’s eligibility.\n3.\nUSCIS recognizes your petition includes statements and supporting evidence referencing the\nbeneficiary’s prior approvals for the requested classification.  USCIS has reviewed this instant petition\nfiled on behalf of the beneficiary.  There has been a material change in circumstances or eligibility\nrequirements.  On Form I-129 Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, your requested filing\nclassification indicates there is a \"Change of Employer\".  Therefore, there has been a material change\nin circumstances or eligibility requirements. \nVSCI129VSCPPI0000344314492 of 16www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

Additionally, if the same or similar evidence was submitted with the\nbeneficiaries’ prior approvals, there was a material error with regard to the previous approval(s).\nAs stated above, despite any previously approved petitions, the petitioner bears the burden to establish\neligibility for each petition that it submits, and an immigration benefit cannot be granted when the\npetitioner fails to meet its burden of proof for the petition it files, including an extension petition.\nTherefore, this petition must be supported by its own documentation and will be adjudicated based\nupon its own merits.

A United States agent may file a petition in cases involving workers\nwho are traditionally self-employed or workers who use agents to arrange short-term\nemployment on their behalf with numerous employers, and in cases where a foreign employer\nauthorizes the agent to act on its behalf. A United States agent may be: the actual employer of\nthe beneficiary; the representative of both the employer and the beneficiary; or, a person or\nentity authorized by the employer to act for, or in place of, the employer as its agent. A\npetition filed by an United States agent is subject to the following conditions:\n(1) An agent performing the function of an employer must specify the wage offered and the\nother terms and conditions of employment by contractual agreement with the beneficiary or\nbeneficiaries. The agent/employer must also provide an itinerary of definite employment\nand information on any other services planned for the period of time requested.\n(2) A person or company in business as an agent may file the P petition involving multiple\nemployers as the representative of both the employers and the beneficiary or beneficiaries if\nthe supporting documentation includes a complete itinerary of services or engagements. The\nitinerary shall specify the dates of each service or engagement, the names and addresses of\nthe actual employers, the names and addresses of the establishment, venues, or locations\nwhere the services will be performed. In questionable cases, a contract between the\nemployer(s) and the beneficiary or beneficiaries may be required. The burden is on the\nagent to explain the terms and conditions of the employment and to provide any required\ndocumentation.\n(3) A foreign employer who, through a United States agent, files a petition for a P\nnonimmigrant alien is responsible for complying with all of the employer sanctions\nprovisions of section 274A of the Act and 8 CFR part 274a.\nUSCIS recognizes your submission of a \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" between the beneficiary\nand petitioner.\nHowever, this document includes conflicting information relating to the relationship between the agent\npetitioner, the beneficiary and the employers who seek to hire the beneficiary for services rendered.\nSpecifically, your included agreement states the following:\nRecitals\nWhereas, the Petitioner is serving in the following roles) as indicated with an X:\n_ Direct Employer\n_ US Agent Functioning as Employer\n_ US Agent for Foreign Employer\nX US Agent for Multiple Employers\nX US Agent for Foreign Employer who is Self-Employed\nAs such, your included documentation appears to assert that the relationship between petitioner and\nagent are both an agent representing both the beneficiary and one or more employers and also an agent\nfiling this petition on behalf of a foreign employer.  \nVSCI129VSCPPI0000344314494 of 16www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

For example, the submitted agreement between you and the beneficiary states the\nfollowing:\nThe applicable Authorization(s) from third-parties to this agreement are included with this\npetition that indicated permission for the petitioner to file this petition and for the petitioner to\nreceive service of process.\nMoreover, your submitted agreement lists the following \"Multiple Employer Activities\" the\nbeneficiary will be engaging in during the requested validity period:\nMultiple Employer Activities\nActivities performed for multiple employers, coordinated and overseen by the Petitioner to\nensure compliance with immigration regulations.\nRepresentation in sponsorship collaborations with natural supplement, apparel, and\nwellness\ncompanies.\nBrand ambassadorship roles involving multiple commercial sponsors coordinated by\nPetitioner.\nService as a consultant, spokesperson, or judge for IFBB Natural Division initiatives.    \nMentoring rising athletes in training, recovery, and longevity strategies           \nEstablishment and development of online brand presence.\nYou indicate the above list relates to \"Activities performed for multiple employers, coordinated and\noverseen by the Petitioner\".  As such, your statements and supporting evidence appear to indicate that\nyou are the agent representing both the beneficiary and one or more employers who seek to hire the\nbeneficiary. \nAs stated above, an agent representing the beneficiary and one or more employers is required to\nsubmit a complete itinerary of services or engagements which specifies the dates of each service or\nengagement, the names and addresses of the actual employers, the names and addresses of the\nestablishment, venues, or locations where the services will be performed.  \nUSCIS recognizes your submission of an itinerary listing the beneficiary's proposed bodybuilding\ncompetitions.  However, you indicate the beneficiary will be engaged in a variety of activities outside\nof competitions including activities where the beneficiary is employed by third party employers.  The\nincluded itinerary does not list any of the referenced sponsorship, ambassadorship, mentoring, etc.\nactivities as listed on the included agreement.  Furthermore, the itinerary does not indicate who the\nbeneficiary's employers will be when engaging in those activities.  As such, the itinerary you\nsubmitted is insufficient to meet the regulatory requirements for agents representing the beneficiary\nand the beneficiary's employers. \nVSCI129VSCPPI0000344314495 of 16www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

The burden is on the agent to explain the terms and\nconditions of the employment and to provide any required documentation.\nAs indicated above, you have provided conflicting statements and supporting documentation relating\nto the relationship between the petitioner and beneficiary.  Moreover, your statements indicate that the\nindustry standard is to receive official invites and sign contracts with the listed competitions in order to\nparticipate.  As such, you are required to submit contracts between the beneficiary and the\nemployers/competitions who seek to hire the beneficiary.\nYou did not provide any contracts between the beneficiary and the employers who seek to hire the\nbeneficiary. \nAs such, you have not established the regulatory requirements for agents representing the beneficiary\nand the one or more employers who seek to hire the beneficiary.\nYou may still submit evidence to satisfy this requirement. \nIn some cases, a contract between the beneficiary and the entity(s) where services will be performed\nmay be required.

As a U.S.\nagent filing for a foreign employer, you must submit evidence that shows: \nYou are authorized to file the petition; and\nYou are authorized to accept service of process on behalf of the employer. \nThe evidence you submitted is insufficient.\nAs stated above, you provided conflicting information relating to the relationship between the agent\npetitioner, the beneficiary and the employers who seek to hire the beneficiary for services rendered. \nYou have provided multiple statements and documentation asserting that you are the agent\nrepresenting the beneficiary and the one or more employers who seek to hire the beneficiary. \nTherefore, the submitted does not establish the requirements for a U.S. agent filing this petition on\nbehalf of a foreign employer.\nMoreover, USCIS recognizes your statements asserting that the beneficiary is self-employed as the\nforeign employer. \nHowever, the included itinerary states the following:\nFor each competition listed in this itinerary, the following supporting documentation should be\ncompiled:\nOfficial Invitation/Registration: Formal documentation confirming acceptance or\ninvitation to compete\n1.\nEvent Promotional Materials: Official flyers, posters, or digital media showing the\ninternational prestige of the event\n2.\nCompetition History: Results from previous years demonstrating international\nparticipation\n3.\nMedia Coverage: Publications highlighting the international significance of the events4.\nGoverning Body Documentation: Letters or statements from IFBB Pro League or NPC\nofficials confirming the international recognition of each competition\n5.\nContract/Agreement: Documentation of agreements to participate in specified\ncompetitions\n6.\nThis itinerary and the supporting evidence demonstrate that the athlete’s participation is\nrequired at internationally recognized competitions, satisfying a key requirement for P-1A visa\nclassification.\nYour statements indicate that to participate in the listed competitions on the included itinerary, an\n\"Official Invitation/Registration: Formal documentation confirming acceptance or invitation to\ncompete\" is required to compete and also there is a \"Contract/Agreement: Documentation of\nagreements to participate in specified competitions\" which is signed prior to participation. \nVSCI129VSCPPI0000344314497 of 16www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

Therefore, while you claim\nthat the beneficiary will be employed by a foreign employer, you have included statements and\nsupporting evidence directly contradicting that assertion.\nDoubt cast upon any aspect of the petitioner’s evidence may lead to a reevaluation of the reliability\nand sufficiency of the remaining evidence offered in support of the visa petition.  See Matter of Ho, 19\nI&N Dec. 582 (BIA 1988).\nMoreover, you submitted no agreement between the beneficiary and a foreign employer outlining the\nterms and conditions of the beneficiary's employment with the foreign employer such as how the\nbeneficiary will be paid, etc.  For example, your representation agreement claims the beneficiary will\nbe compensated at a rate of $80,000.00 USD annually, but this document includes no contractual\ndocumentation relating to how or by whom the beneficiary will be paid.  As such, you have not\nestablished that the beneficiary will be employed by a foreign employer during the requested validity\nperiod. \nYou may still submit evidence to satisfy this requirement. \nRequirements for Athletes and Teams\nBeneficiaries may obtain P-1A classification by:\nInternational recognition as an individual athlete or member of a team;\nBeing classified as a professional athlete;\nPerforming as an athlete or coach with a U.S. team in a foreign league; or\nPerforming individually or as part of a group in a theatrical ice skating production.\nTo satisfy this requirement, you submitted:\nForm I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker;\nForm I-129, O and P Classifications Supplement to Form I-129;\nPetitioner Support Letter;\nPrior approval notices;\nProductions/Events supporting documentation;\nMedia articles and supporting documentation;\nRepresentation agreement between beneficiary and petitioner;\nItinerary; and\nBeneficiary’s identity documents.\nBeneficiary Qualifications\nYou indicate the beneficiary qualifies for P-1 non-immigrant status.  As defined in statute and\nregulation, a beneficiary may qualify for the P-1A classification as an internationally recognized\nathlete, a professional athlete, an amateur athlete, or as a professional or amateur skater who performs\nindividually or as part of a group in a theatrical ice skating production.  \nAs you do not claim the beneficiary qualifies as an amateur athlete or a professional or amateur skater\nwho performs individually or as a part of a group in a theatrical ice skating production, these grounds\nof eligibility will not be discussed further in this request. \nInternationally Recognized Athlete or Team\nVSCI129VSCPPI0000344314498 of 16www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

Alternatively, athletes coming to the United States to perform in theatrical ice skating\nproductions must be coming solely to perform in specific ice skating productions or tours.  Permissible\nactivities also include short vacations, promotional appearances for the petitioning employer relating to\nthe competition, event or performance, and stopovers which are incidental and/or related to the\nactivity.\nThe evidence you submitted is insufficient to establish that the beneficiary will be performing\n(including permissible related/incidental activities) solely as an athlete with respect to a specific\nathletic competition.\nThe submitted agreement between petitioner and beneficiary states the following relating to the\nbeneficiary's various \"Self-Employment Activities\" during the requested validity period:\nSelf-Employment Activities\nActivities undertaken by the Beneficiary as a self-employed individual, with oversight and\nfacilitation by the Petitioner in compliance with USCIS requirements.\nParticipation in 2-3 IFBB Natural Pro shows annually (domestic and international).\nPublic documentation of competition preparation to promote the growth of the natural\nbodybuilding division.\nMedia appearances and promotional campaigns for sponsors and league branding.\nSpeaking engagements at athlete panels, summits, and workshops.   \nCollaboration with IFBB Natural Division to promote its expansion. \nDevelopment and launch of a natural athlete coaching program.\nCreation of educational online content series.\nMentorship collaborations with wellness and fitness groups such as Elite Wellness Group\nYou indicate that the beneficiary will be engaging in \"Public documentation of competition\npreparation to promote the growth of the natural bodybuilding division\", \"Media appearances and\npromotional campaigns for sponsors and league branding\", \"Speaking engagements at athlete panels,\nsummits, and workshops\", \"Collaboration with IFBB Natural Division to promote its expansion\",\nDevelopment and launch of a natural athlete coaching program\", \"Creation of educational online\nVSCI129VSCPPI0000344314499 of 16www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

He aims to\ncontribute positively to the bodybuilding community by guiding aspiring athletes, promoting\nbest practices in training, fitness, and competitive preparation, and sharing insights gained\nthrough his own successful international career.\nAs stated above, the beneficiary must be coming to the United States solely for the purpose of\nperforming in a specific athletic competition as an athlete or coach, as applicable. \nYour submitted documentation lists a variety of engagements that are not for the purpose of\nperforming in a specific athletic competition as an athlete or coach.  As such, you have not satisfied\nthis requirement. \nYou may still submit evidence to satisfy this requirement.\nInternationally Recognized Level of Competition\nThe evidence in the record must demonstrate that the beneficiary (as an individual athlete or as a\nmember of an athletic team) is coming to the United States to participate in an athletic competition or\nleague that has a distinguished reputation and which requires  participation of an athlete or athletic\nteam that has an international reputation.  \nThe evidence you submitted is insufficient.\nVSCI129VSCPPI00003443144910 of 16www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

However, while these documents provide a general overview of the events, they do not\nsufficiently establish how and/or why these events could be considered an athletic competition or\nleague that has a distinguished reputation and which requires  participation of an athlete or athletic\nteam that has an international reputation.  \nFor example, many of the included documents indicates that anyone paying a fee can participate in the\nevents.  They do not specifically articulate how and/or why these events could be considered an\nathletic competition or league that has a distinguished reputation and which requires  participation of\nan athlete or athletic team that has an international reputation.  \nFurthermore, some of the events have various prequalifying conditions.

The individual must\nhave sustained national or international acclaim.  The individual's achievements must be in the field of expertise and show that the\nindividual is one of a small percentage who has risen to the very top of the field.  The individual must be coming to the United States to\ncontinue work in the individual's area of extraordinary ability.\nPursuant to the preponderance of evidence standard, USCIS will examine each piece of evidence for relevance, probative value, and\ncredibility, both individually and within the context of the totality of evidence, to determine whether the fact to be proven is probably\ntrue.  USCIS comprehensively reviews the entire body of evidence before rendering a final determination of eligibility.  Upon review of the\nevidence you submitted in the initial filing, the record contains insufficient documentation to establish the beneficiary meets the regulatory\nrequirements for the O-1A classification. \nTo process your petition and determine if the beneficiary is eligible, additional information is required.  This request provides suggested\nevidence that you may submit to satisfy each requested item.  You may:\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\nVermont Service Center \nIOE8520954561\nVSCI129VSCPPI0000362561591 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nSubmit one, some, or all of these items;\nSubmit none of the suggested items and instead submit other evidence to satisfy the request;\nExplain how the evidence in the record already establishes eligibility; and/or\nRequest a decision based on the record. \nNote, however, that you are responsible for providing evidence that best shows that you and the parties to this petition meet all requirements. \nEvidence must show that all parties were eligible for the requested benefit when you filed Form I-129.\nNote: When submitting additional evidence, please indicate to which individual criterion it applies.  If you choose to submit comparable\nevidence in lieu of one or more of the criteria below, please indicate why the criteria you wish to replace do not apply to the occupation.  \nAdditionally, when submitting articles, internet abstracts, and other documentation (excluding testimonial letters) that includes the\nbeneficiary’s name, please highlight the beneficiary’s name.  \nPlease submit evidence that is the most current and is presented in an orderly fashion. Illegible photocopies will not be accepted as valid\nevidence.\nRequest for Translations\nAll foreign language documents must have a complete English translation to establish eligibility.  This includes any documents you submit in\nresponse to this Request for Evidence.  In order for USCIS to consider this evidence, you must submit English language translations for each\ndocument.  The translator must certify that:\nThe translations are accurate and complete; and\nThe translator is competent to translate from the foreign language into English.\nPrior Approvals\nUSCIS acknowledges that the beneficiary has previously been granted the benefit being sought and that you have requested USCIS grant\ndeference to prior approvals when evaluating the beneficiary's eligibility for the benefit being sought.  When adjudicating a subsequent\npetition or application involving the same parties and the same underlying facts, where appropriate, USCIS will generally defer to its prior\ndetermination of eligibility for the particular nonimmigrant classification sought.\nHowever, each petition filing is a separate proceeding with a separate record.  Despite any previously approved petitions, the petitioner bears\nthe burden to establish eligibility for each petition that it submits, and an immigration benefit cannot be granted when the petitioner fails to\nmeet its burden of proof for the petition it files, including an extension petition. See INA § 291.  USCIS is not required to approve petitions\nwhere eligibility has not been demonstrated, merely because of prior approvals which may have been erroneous.  Matter of Church\nScientology International, 19 I&N Dec. 593, 597 (Comm'r 1988).\nUSCIS will not defer to prior approvals where:\nThere was a material error with regard to the previous approval(s);  1.\nThere has been a material change in circumstances or eligibility requirements; or  2.\nThere is new material information that adversely impacts the petitioner’s, beneficiary’s, or applicant’s eligibility.3.\nUSCIS recognizes your petition includes statements and supporting evidence referencing the beneficiary’s prior approval for the requested\nclassification.  USCIS has reviewed this instant petition filed on behalf of the beneficiary.   On Form I-129 Petition for a Nonimmigrant\nWorker, your requested filing classification indicates that the basis for requested classification is \"Change of Employer”.  Therefore, there has\nbeen a material change in circumstances or eligibility requirements.\nFurthermore, USCIS reviewed the instant petition filed on behalf of the beneficiary and recognizes your request to grant deference to the prior\napprovals the beneficiary has received.  However, you have not satisfied the regulatory requirements relating to general evidence required to\naccompany all O petitions as described under 8 CFR 214.2(o)(2)(ii).  \nAdditionally, you have not established the requirements for agent petitioners as described under 8 CFR 214.2(o)(2)(iv)(E).\nAs such, if the same or similar evidence was submitted with the beneficiary's prior approval as has been submitted with this instant petition,\nthan there was a material error with regard to the previous approval. \nAs stated above, despite any previously approved petitions, the petitioner bears the burden to establish eligibility for each petition that it\nsubmits, and an immigration benefit cannot be granted when the petitioner fails to meet its burden of proof for the petition it files, including\nan extension petition.\nMoreover, you submitted no evidence of the beneficiary's prior approvals for the benefit being sought with this petition. \nTherefore, this petition must be supported by its own documentation and will be adjudicated based upon its own merits.  A more detailed\ndiscussion about the deficiencies will be discussed below.  USCIS will not defer to its prior approval in adjudicating this petition.\nTherefore, USCIS will not defer to its prior approval in adjudicating this petition.\nVSCI129VSCPPI0000362561592 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

If a written contract does not exist, you may submit a detailed summary of the terms of the oral agreement between the\nbeneficiary and either the petitioner or the employer.\nThe contract you submitted is insufficient.\nThe documentation you submitted is insufficient in establishing the regulatory requirements relating to contracts.  \nSpecifically, your support letter states that \"The petitioner, Innovative Global Talent Agency, LLC, is serving in the capacity of U.S. Agent\nfor Foreign Employer.\"  However, the included documentation appears to indicate that you are the beneficiary's agent representing the\nbeneficiary and the one or more employers who seek to hire them.  As such, the submitted documentation does not sufficiently establish the\nterms and conditions of the beneficiary's employment. \nFor example, you submitted a \"US AGENT REPRESENTATION AGREEMENT\" which outlines the role of the petitioner agent under this\npetition.  Your agreement indicates that the petitioner's role is to \"Negotiate and coordinate arrangements with U.S. venues, promoters,\nfacilities, and business partners\".  You seek to hire the beneficiary as a \"World class Martial Artist\".  \nYour agreement further outlines the petitioner's role, indicating that:\n5.2 Activity Coordination U.S. Agent will:\nCoordinate scheduling of Beneficiary's U.S. activities\nFacilitate arrangements with venues, promoters, and facilities\nManage logistics for training camps, competitions, and promotional events\nServe as point of contact for U.S. entities booking Beneficiary's services\nEnsure compliance with terms of O-1 status and employment agreement\nCoordinate travel arrangements as needed\n5.3 Industry Relationship Management U.S. Agent will:\nMaintain relationships with U.S. combat sports promoters and venues\nFacilitate introductions between Foreign Employer and U.S. industry entities\nCoordinate partnership discussions and business development meetings\nSupport Foreign Employer’s market expansion objectives\nVSCI129VSCPPI0000362561593 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nIdentify opportunities for Beneficiary's professional advancement\nThe submitted agreement between petitioner and beneficiary appears to indicate that the petitioner is the beneficiary's agent representing the\nbeneficiary and the multiple employers who seek to hire them, including a foreign employer. \nAdditionally, you submitted an \"Employment Agreement\" between the beneficiary and Boza Investment SARL which lists the following\ncontractually obligated duties:\nA. Professional Fighting Activities\nCompete in professional mixed martial arts competitions at championship level\nParticipate in bouts sanctioned by premier combat sports organizations including but not limited to Professional Fighters\nLeague (PFL), boxing matches, and other elite promotions\nMaintain peak physical conditioning and athletic performance standards\nUndergo rigorous training camps in preparation for competitions\nRepresent Foreign Employer’s brand through competitive excellence and championship-caliber performance\nThis agreement states that the beneficiary is contractually obligated to \"Compete in professional mixed martial arts competitions at\nchampionship level\" and \"Participate in bouts sanctioned by premier combat sports organizations including but not limited to Professional\nFighters League (PFL), boxing matches, and other elite promotions\".  \nPlease note, a search of publicly available records indicates that the Professional Fighters League (PFL), signs exclusive promotional fight\nagreements with athletes participating in their bouts.  For example, the PFL website includes an article which states the following:\nNew York (September 5, 2025) - The Professional Fighters League (PFL) today announced the signing of Middleweight contender\nBryan Battle (12-2, 1 NC) to an exclusive, multi-year contract.\nProfessional Fighter’s League (PFL). MIDDLEWEIGHT CONTENDER BRYAN BATTLE SIGNS EXCLUSIVE, MULTI-YEAR\nCONTRACT WITH PROFESSIONAL FIGHTERS LEAGUE.\nhttps://pflmma.com/news/middleweight-contender-bryan-battle-signs-exclusive-multiyear-contract-with-professional-fighters-league.\nAccessed October 29, 2025.\nMoreover, you submitted an article from the New York Times that states the beneficiary signed \"an unusual multifight contract with a rival\npromotional company, the Professional Fighters League\" covering a 2024 bout. \nFurthermore, such arrangements appear to be the industry standard in \"mixed martial arts competitions at championship level\".  For example,\nan article in Forbes, entitled “How Long Are UFC Exclusive Contracts? Witness In Antitrust Suit Sheds Rare Light On MMA’s Business\nSide”, states the following:\nA key part of the plaintiffs’ claims against the UFC is that it purportedly locks fighters into long-term exclusive contracts, depriving\nrival MMA promoters from the critical inputs they need to compete. \nGift, Paul. (2020). Forbes, \"How Long Are UFC Exclusive Contracts? Witness In Antitrust Suit Sheds Rare Light On MMA’s\nBusiness Side\". https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulgift/2020/11/10/how-long-are-ufc-exclusive-contracts/. Accessed October 29, 2025.\nMoreover, your included contracts state the following under \"Article IV: Employment and Compensation Structure\":\n4.2 Independent Contractor Arrangements\nFor specific competition events. Beneficiary may serve as independent contractor to individual fight promoters\nAll independent contractor arrangements: \nCoordinated and approved by Foreign Employer\nNegotiated with Foreign Employer oversight\nSupplement (not replace) base employment compensation\nForeign Employer maintains ultimate authority over competition schedule and terms\nThe included contract contradicts with your statements relating to this petition being filed by an agent representing a foreign employer for the\nbeneficiary.  Contrarily, your included contract appears to indicate that when competing the beneficiary is an independent contractor.\nFurthermore, publicly available information relating to combat industry standards indicates that combat sports and/or boxing athletes are\ntraditionally self-employed and make contractual agreements directly with promoters for one or more scheduled bouts.\nFor example, a publicly available article from The Manual indicates the following relating to UFC fighter contracts:\nHave you ever wondered what a UFC fighter’s contract looks like? When an MMA competitor signs a contract to fight three to four\nVSCI129VSCPPI0000362561594 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

Instead of a union serving as an exclusive representative to collectively bargain\nwith the UFC for wages, hours, and working conditions, each professional is on his or her own, operating essentially as an\nindependent contractor. Under these agreements, fighters are obligated by the terms of contracts, no matter how onerous. And they\nhave no recourse should they be summarily released.\nDenis, M. (2022). The Manual. “This is what you need to know about top-secret UFC fighter contracts With no union representation,\nthe UFC retains lucrative rights”. https://www.themanual.com/culture/ufc-fighter-contract/. Accessed October 28, 2025.\nAs such, publicly available evidence indicates that combat sports and/or boxing athletes are traditionally self-employed and make contractual\nagreements directly with promoters for one or more scheduled bouts.\nBased on conditions commonly contained in exclusive promotional agreements, as described in the articles referenced, it appears that control\nover the beneficiary’s employment rests largely with the promotional company.  Correspondingly, the prevalence of such agreements directly\ncontradicts supporting evidence suggesting that you would retain a level of control indicative of a US Agent representing a foreign employer. \nAs such, the submitted documentation appears to indicate that you are the beneficiary's agent representing the beneficiary and the one or\nmore employers who seek to hire them. \nHowever, you submitted no exclusive bout agreements with the PFL or other combat sports leagues covering any portion of the requested\nvalidity period.  Moreover, you submitted no documentation that Boza Investment SARL has any affiliation to or authorization from the PFL\nto contract athletes to participate in their events and file petitions on their behalf.\nAdditionally, your itinerary states that the first quarter of the beneficiary's requested stay will include \"Ongoing negotiations for professional\nfighting return\".  It also includes multiple line items outlining the beneficiary's activity \"If major fight announced\".  This appears to indicate\nthat the beneficiary has no bouts scheduled during the requested validity period and that you have filed a speculative petition. \nIn addition, your included employment agreement between the beneficiary and Boza Investment SARL indicates the beneficiary is obligated\nto participate in a wide variety of activities that are not supported with contractual documentation.  For example, this document states that the\nbeneficiary will participate in:\nRegular podcast appearances (scheduled monthly):\nJoe Rogan Experience (Austin, TX - travel dates TBD)\nFighter and the Kid (Los Angeles)\nAriel Helwani’s MMA Hour (conducted remotely or in-person)\nAlso:\nMonthly travel to Los Angeles (2-3 days per visit)\nMeetings with entertainment industry representatives for potential acting opportunities\nAppearances on major sports talk shows: \nESPN Los Angeles studios, 800 W Olympic Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90015\nFox Sports studios, 10201 W Pico Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90064\nSponsor meetings and brand partnership activations\nHigh-profile gym training sessions (potential appearances at various LA MMA facilities)\nHowever, you did not include any contractual documentation from any of the referenced programs outlining the terms and conditions of the\nbeneficiary's monthly appearances on the listed programs.  Moreover, you submitted no documentation that Boza Investment SARL has any\naffiliation to or authorization from the listed programs to contract individuals to participate in their programs and file petitions on their behalf.\nThe included documentation does not sufficiently establish the terms and conditions of the beneficiary's employment during the requested\nvalidity period. \nYou may still submit evidence to satisfy the requirements specified below. \nThe contract and itinerary does not establish an event or activity, or a series of connected events or activities that would allow for the full\nvalidity period requested.  \nIf the information you provide does not support approval of the full validity period requested, the period granted will be based on the evidence\nprovided, which may be a limited validity period. \nWritten contracts, or the summary of the terms of an oral agreement, must specify the terms and conditions of the employment or services. \nThey must: \nVSCI129VSCPPI0000362561595 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

An event means an activity such as a scientific project, conference, convention, lecture series, academic year, or\nengagement during the requested validity period.  If you are filing for an O-1 athlete, a copy of the contract may satisfy this requirement. \nThe description you submitted is insufficient.\nduration of the requested validity period.\n8 CFR 214.2(o)(2)(ii) states the following relating to evidence required to accompany all O petitions:\n(ii) Evidence required to accompany a petition. Petitions for O aliens shall be accompanied by the following:\n(A) The evidence specified in the particular section for the classification;\n(B) Copies of any written contracts between the petitioner and the alien beneficiary or, if there is no written contract, a summary of\nthe terms of the oral agreement under which the alien will be employed;\n(C) An explanation of the nature of the events or activities, the beginning and ending dates for the events or activities, and a copy of\nany itinerary for the events or activities; and\n(D) A written advisory opinion(s) from the appropriate consulting entity or entities.\nYour included itinerary does not satisfy the regulatory requirements relating to documentation required to be submitted with all O petitions. \nSpecifically, you indicate that the beneficiary will be participating in a wide variety of productions and events where the specific dates,\nlocations and employers are not listed.  For example, you state the beneficiary will be participating in podcasts and media appearances\nmonthly, but you have provided no dates and list the locations as TBD.  Furthermore, you claim the beneficiary will be participating in PFL\ncompetitions.  However, you not provided any specific details relating to any specific bouts the beneficiary will participate in.  The included\ndocumentation does not sufficiently establish the nature of the events or activities and the beginning and ending dates for the events or\nactivities.\nYou may still submit evidence to satisfy this requirement. \nThe description must include: \nAn explanation of the nature of the events or activities;\nBeginning and ending dates of the events or activities; and\nA copy of any itinerary that shows dates, name(s) of the employer(s), and location of the event(s). \nConsultation\nPetitions seeking O-1A nonimmigrant classification must include a written advisory opinion from a U.S. peer group, labor organization,\nand/or management organization in the area of the beneficiary’s ability.  The U.S. peer group may include a person or persons with expertise\nin the field. \nThe documentation you submitted is insufficient. USCIS recognizes your statements indicating that a labor organization does not exist in the\nbeneficiary's field of expertise.  Furthermore, USCIS recognizes your submission of letters from the beneficiary's peer group.  While these\nletters provide a general overview of the beneficiary's background and expertise, they do not specifically explain the nature of the duties to\nbe performed by the beneficiary and they do not sufficiently explain how and/or why the beneficiary's position specifically required the\nservices of an individual of extraordinary ability. \nYou may submit a new consultation which meets the requirements specified below. \nA consultation is a written advisory opinion regarding the nature of the work and the beneficiary’s qualifications.  The advisory opinion must\nstate: \nThe beneficiary’s ability and achievements in the field of endeavor;\nThe nature of the duties to be performed; and\nWhether the position requires the services of an individual of extraordinary ability. \nThe opinion should contain a statement of facts that supports the conclusion reached in the opinion.  If it is provided by a group or an\norganization, it must be signed by an authorized official of the group or organization.  A consulting organization may also submit a letter of\nno objection if it has no objection to the approval of the petition.\nAgents\nVSCI129VSCPPI0000362561596 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

Except as provided for in paragraph (o)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, a petitioner seeking to classify an alien as an O–1 or O–2\nnonimmigrant shall file a petition on the form prescribed by USCIS. The petition may not be filed more than one year before the\nactual need for the alien's services. An O–1 or O–2 petition shall be adjudicated at the appropriate Service Center, even in emergency\nsituations. Only one beneficiary may be included on an O–1 petition. O–2 aliens must be filed for on a separate petition from the\nO–1 alien. An O–1 or O–2 petition may only be filed by a United States employer, a United States agent, or a foreign employer\nthrough a United States agent. For purposes of paragraph o of this section, a foreign employer is any employer who is not amenable\nto service of process in the United States. A foreign employer may not directly petition for an O nonimmigrant alien but instead must\nuse the services of a United States agent to file a petition for an O nonimmigrant alien. A United States agent petitioning on behalf of\na foreign employer must be authorized to file the petition, and to accept services of process in the United States in proceedings under\nsection 274A of the Act, on behalf of the foreign employer. An O alien may not petition for himself or herself.\nAs such, an O petition may be filed by a United States employer, a United States agent, or a foreign employer through a United States agent.\nThe documentation you submitted is insufficient in establishing the regulatory requirements relating to agent petitioners.  You provided\nconflicting statements and documentation relating to the petitioner, beneficiary and employers. \nSpecifically, your support letter states that \"The petitioner, Innovative Global Talent Agency, LLC, is serving in the capacity of U.S. Agent\nfor Foreign Employer.\"  However, the included documentation appears to indicate that you are the beneficiary's agent representing the\nbeneficiary and the one or more employers who seek to hire them.  As such, the submitted documentation does not sufficiently establish the\nnature of the relationship between all parties.  As such, the deficiencies in each claimed relationship will be discussed in detail below. \nYou submitted a \"US AGENT REPRESENTATION AGREEMENT\" which outlines the role of the petitioner agent under this petition.

For example,\nan article in Forbes, entitled “How Long Are UFC Exclusive Contracts? Witness In Antitrust Suit Sheds Rare Light On MMA’s Business\nSide”, states the following:\nA key part of the plaintiffs’ claims against the UFC is that it purportedly locks fighters into long-term exclusive contracts, depriving\nrival MMA promoters from the critical inputs they need to compete. \nGift, Paul.

Contrarily, your included contract appears to indicate that when competing the beneficiary is an independent contractor.\nFurthermore, publicly available information relating to combat industry standards indicates that combat sports and/or boxing athletes are\ntraditionally self-employed and make contractual agreements directly with promoters for one or more scheduled bouts.\nFor example, a publicly available article from The Manual indicates the following relating to UFC fighter contracts:\nHave you ever wondered what a UFC fighter’s contract looks like? When an MMA competitor signs a contract to fight three to four\nannual fights, they give away representational rights. Instead of a union serving as an exclusive representative to collectively bargain\nwith the UFC for wages, hours, and working conditions, each professional is on his or her own, operating essentially as an\nindependent contractor. Under these agreements, fighters are obligated by the terms of contracts, no matter how onerous. And they\nhave no recourse should they be summarily released.\nDenis, M. (2022). The Manual. “This is what you need to know about top-secret UFC fighter contracts With no union representation,\nthe UFC retains lucrative rights”. https://www.themanual.com/culture/ufc-fighter-contract/. Accessed October 28, 2025.\nAs such, publicly available evidence indicates that combat sports and/or boxing athletes are traditionally self-employed and make contractual\nagreements directly with promoters for one or more scheduled bouts.\nBased on conditions commonly contained in exclusive promotional agreements, as described in the articles referenced, it appears that control\nover the beneficiary’s employment rests largely with the promotional company.  Correspondingly, the prevalence of such agreements directly\ncontradicts supporting evidence suggesting that you would retain a level of control indicative of a US Agent representing a foreign employer. \nAs such, the submitted documentation appears to indicate that you are the beneficiary's agent representing the beneficiary and the one or\nmore employers who seek to hire them, not an agent representing a foreign employer as you claim. \nAs stated above, agents representing both the beneficiary and one or more employers must submit contracts between the beneficiary and the\nentities with whom the beneficiary will perform services, explaining the terms and conditions of employment and you must submit evidence\nthat the agent is authorized to act as an agent on behalf of the beneficiary and all of the entities with whom the beneficiary is contracted to\nperform the services.\nHowever, you submitted no exclusive bout agreements with the PFL or other combat sports leagues covering any portion of the requested\nvalidity period.  Moreover, you submitted no documentation that Boza Investment SARL has any affiliation to or authorization from the PFL\nto contract athletes to participate in their events and file petitions on their behalf. \nAdditionally, your itinerary states that the first quarter of the beneficiary's requested stay will include \"Ongoing negotiations for professional\nfighting return\".  It also includes multiple line items outlining the beneficiary's activity \"If major fight announced\".  This appears to indicate\nthat the beneficiary has no bouts scheduled during the requested validity period and that you have filed a speculative petition. \nIn addition, your included employment agreement between the beneficiary and Boza Investment SARL indicates the beneficiary is obligated\nto participate in a wide variety of activities that are not supported with contractual documentation.  For example, this document states that the\nbeneficiary will participate in:\nRegular podcast appearances (scheduled monthly):\nJoe Rogan Experience (Austin, TX - travel dates TBD)\nFighter and the Kid (Los Angeles)\nAriel Helwani’s MMA Hour (conducted remotely or in-person)\nAlso:\nMonthly travel to Los Angeles (2-3 days per visit)\nMeetings with entertainment industry representatives for potential acting opportunities\nAppearances on major sports talk shows: \nESPN Los Angeles studios, 800 W Olympic Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90015\nFox Sports studios, 10201 W Pico Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90064\nSponsor meetings and brand partnership activations\nVSCI129VSCPPI0000362561599 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

Moreover, you submitted no documentation that Boza Investment SARL has any\naffiliation to or authorization from the listed programs to contract individuals to participate in their programs and file petitions on their behalf.  \nAs such, you have not established the contract requirement for agents representing the beneficiary and one or more employers.\nMoreover, as stated above, agents representing both the beneficiary and one or more employers must submit a complete itinerary of services\nor engagements that specifies the dates of each service or engagement, provides the names and addresses of the entities with whom the\nbeneficiary is contracted to perform the services and provides the names and addresses of the establishments, venues, or locations where the\nservices will be performed. \nHowever, your included itinerary does not satisfy the regulatory requirements relating to the requirements for agent petitioners representing\nthe beneficiary and the one or more employers who seek to hire them.  \nSpecifically, you indicate that the beneficiary will be participating in a wide variety of productions and events where the specific dates of\neach service or engagement, the names and addresses of the entities with whom the beneficiary is contracted to perform the services and and\nthe names and addresses of the establishments, venues, or locations where the services will be performed are not listed.  For example, you\nstate the beneficiary will be participating in podcasts and media appearances monthly, but you have provided no dates and list the locations as\nTBD.  Furthermore, you claim the beneficiary will be participating in PFL competitions.  However, you not provided any specific details\nrelating to any specific bouts the beneficiary will participate in.  The included documentation does not include the specific dates of each\nservice or engagement, provides the names and addresses of the entities with whom the beneficiary is contracted to perform the services and\nprovides the names and addresses of the establishments, venues, or locations where the services will be performed. .\nUSCIS recognizes your submission of an itinerary.  However, while you provided the city of each engagement, you did not provide the names\nand addresses of the establishments, venues, or locations where the services will be performed as required by regulation.\nFurthermore, you did not provide any specific dates of service or engagement as required by regulation.  Listing the month of each\nproduction or event is insufficient.  USCIS recognizes that providing specific dates for each production and event may be difficult.  However,\nyou provided no specific dates of any production or event the beneficiary is scheduled to perform/work in. \nTherefore, the submitted evidence does not establish the regulatory requirements for agents representing the beneficiary and one or more\nemployers.\nYou may still submit evidence to satisfy this requirement. \nForeign Employers\nIt appears that you are a U.S. agent filing this petition on behalf of a foreign employer.  You must submit evidence that shows you are\nauthorized to: \nFile the petition; and\nAccept service of process in the United States on behalf of the foreign\nemployer.                                                                                                                                               \nThe evidence you submitted is insufficient.\nAs stated above, you provided conflicting statements and documentation relating to the petitioner, beneficiary and employers. \nSpecifically, your support letter states that \"The petitioner, Innovative Global Talent Agency, LLC, is serving in the capacity of U.S. Agent\nfor Foreign Employer.\"  However, the included documentation appears to indicate that you are the beneficiary's agent representing the\nbeneficiary and the one or more employers who seek to hire them.  As such, the submitted evidence does not sufficiently establish the\nrequirements for a U.S. agent filing on behalf of a foreign employer. \nYou submitted a \"US AGENT REPRESENTATION AGREEMENT\" which outlines the role of the petitioner agent under this petition.  Your\nagreement indicates that the petitioner's role is to \"Negotiate and coordinate arrangements with U.S. venues, promoters, facilities, and business\npartners\".  You seek to hire the beneficiary as a \"World class Martial Artist\".  \nYour agreement further outlines the petitioner's role, indicating that:\n5.2 Activity Coordination U.S. Agent will:\nCoordinate scheduling of Beneficiary's U.S. activities\nFacilitate arrangements with venues, promoters, and facilities\nManage logistics for training camps, competitions, and promotional events\nServe as point of contact for U.S. entities booking Beneficiary's services\nEnsure compliance with terms of O-1 status and employment agreement\nVSCI129VSCPPI00003625615910 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

  "IOE8860202012 - Denial (1).pdf": "\n\nOctober 2, 2025 \nINNOVATIVE GLOBAL TALENT AGENCY\nc/o LANITA WILKS\n1069 SYCAMORE GREEN PI\nCHARLOTTE, NC 28202 \nRE: BELLA BARI SCHNEIDER DA COSTA\nI-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker\nDECISION\nDear Sir/Madam, \nOn June 26, 2025, you filed a Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, to classify the\nbeneficiary as an athlete under section 101(a)(15)(P)(i)(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act\n(Act).\nYour Petition\nYou are a talent agency established in 2024.  Your currently employ two individuals.  You seek to \nrepresent the beneficiary as a \"World Class Trick Rider\" for a period of one year at a salary of $2,500\nper performance.\nThe initial record did not establish the beneficiary qualifies for P-1 nonimmigrant classification. The\ninitial record did not demonstrate:\nWritten contracts between the petitioner and the alien beneficiary or, if there is no written\ncontract, a summary of the terms of the oral agreement under which the beneficiary will be\nemployed as required by Title 8 Code of Federal Regulations (8 CFR) section 214.2(p)(2)(ii);\nYou satisfied all of the conditions for an: \nAgent functioning as an employer as defined in 8 CFR 214.2(p)(2)(iv)(E)(1); and\nAgent representing the beneficiary and multiple employers as defined in 8 CFR\n214.2(p)(2)(iv)(E)(2).\nThe beneficiary is coming to the United States solely for the purpose of performing in a\nspecific athletic competition as an athlete as defined in section 214(c)(4)(A)(ii)(1);\nThe beneficiary is coming to the United States to participate in an athletic competition which\nhas a distinguished reputation and which requires participation of an athlete or athletic team that\nhas an international reputation as required in 8 CFR 214.2(p)(4)(ii)(A); and\nThe beneficiary has a tendered contract with a major United States sports league or team, or a\ntendered contract in an individual sport commensurate with international recognition in that\nsport, if such contracts are normally executed in the poker as required in 8 CFR\n214.2(p)(4)(ii)(B)(1).\nTherefore, on July 15, 2025, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued a request for\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\nVermont Service Center \nIOE8860202012\nVSCI129VSCPPD0000359679011 of 16www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nTherefore, on July 15, 2025, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued a request for\nevidence (RFE) seeking additional documentation to overcome the deficiencies in the record.   \nOn September 16, 2025, USCIS received your response to the RFE which includes the following\nevidence:\nAn RFE response letter;\nA letter from the beneficiary authorizing you to act as an agent on behalf of her business entity;\nA \"Petition & Beneficiary Agreement\";\n\"Specialty Act\" contracts between the beneficiary and contracting parties;\nAn updated Itinerary of U.S. Engagements;\nA \"Foreign Employment Terms\" agreement between the beneficiary and her business entity;\nA photograph of the beneficary's rodeo cards;\n A testimonial letters;\nEmail correspondence;\nPhotographs of the beneficiary's belt buckles;\nPhotographs of the beneficiary's identification for rodeo events;\nPhotocopies of articles and programs; and\nPhotographs of award ribbons and trophy.\nThe record does not establish the beneficiary qualifies for the P-1A classification. All deficiencies in\nthe record will be further discussed below.\nPrior Approvals\nUSCIS acknowledges that you are requesting to extend the beneficiary's current status as an P-1A\nnonimmigrant.  When adjudicating a subsequent petition or application involving the same parties and\nthe same underlying facts, where appropriate, USCIS will generally defer to its prior determination of\neligibility for the particular nonimmigrant classification sought.\nHowever, each petition filing is a separate proceeding with a separate record.  Despite any previously\napproved petitions, the petitioner bears the burden to establish eligibility for each petition that it\nsubmits, and an immigration benefit cannot be granted when the petitioner fails to meet its burden of\nproof for the petition it files, including an extension petition. See INA § 291.  USCIS is not required to\napprove petitions where eligibility has not been demonstrated, merely because of prior approvals\nwhich may have been erroneous.  Matter of Church Scientology International, 19 I&N Dec. 593, 597\n(Comm'r 1988).\nUSCIS will not defer to prior approvals where:\nThere was a material error with regard to the previous approval(s);  1.\nThere has been a material change in circumstances or eligibility requirements; or  2.\nThere is new material information that adversely impacts the petitioner’s, beneficiary’s, or\napplicant’s eligibility.\n3.\nUSCIS recognizes your petition includes statements and supporting evidence referencing the\nbeneficiary’s prior approvals for the requested classification.  USCIS has reviewed this instant petition\nfiled on behalf of the beneficiary.  There has been a material change in circumstances or eligibility\nrequirements.  On Form I-129 Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, your requested filing\nclassification indicates there is a \"Change of Employer\".  Therefore, there has been a material change\nin circumstances or eligibility requirements. \nAdditionally, you have not established the requirements for agent petitioners as described under 8\nVSCI129VSCPPD0000359679012 of 16www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nAdditionally, you have not established the requirements for agent petitioners as described under 8\nCFR 214.2(p)(2)(iv)(E).  As such, there is new material information that adversely impacts the\npetitioner’s, beneficiaries’, or applicant’s eligibility.  \nFurthermore, if the same or similar evidence was submitted with the beneficiaries’ prior approvals,\nthere was a material error with regard to the previous approval(s).\nAs stated above, despite any previously approved petitions, the petitioner bears the burden to establish\neligibility for each petition that it submits, and an immigration benefit cannot be granted when the\npetitioner fails to meet its burden of proof for the petition it files, including an extension petition.\nTherefore, this petition must be supported by its own documentation and will be adjudicated based\nupon its own merits.  A more detailed discussion about the deficiencies will be discussed below.\nUSCIS will not defer to its prior approval in adjudicating this petition.\nGeneral Requirements\nTitle 8 CFR section 214.2(p)(2)(ii) states:\nEvidence required to accompany a petition for a P nonimmigrant. Petitions for P nonimmigrant\naliens shall be accompanied by the following:\nA. The evidence specified in the specific section of this part for the classification;\nB. Copies of any written contracts between the petitioner and the alien beneficiary or, if\nthere is no written contract, a summary of the terms of the oral agreement under which\nthe alien(s) will be employed;\nC. An explanation of the nature of the events or activities, the beginning and ending\ndates for the events or activities, and a copy of any itinerary for the events or activities;\nand\nD. A written consultation from a labor organization.\nContracts\nThe first issue is whether you have satisfied the contract requirement. Title 8 CFR 214.2(p)(2)(ii)(B)\nrequires copies of any written contracts between the petitioner and the alien beneficiary or, if there is\nno written contract, a summary of the terms of the oral agreement under which the beneficiary will be\nemployed.\nIn addition,  8 CFR 103.2(b)(1) states:\n(b) Evidence and processing\n(1) Demonstrating eligibility. An applicant or petitioner must establish that he or she is\neligible for the requested benefit at the time of filing the benefit request and must\ncontinue to be eligible through adjudication. Each benefit request must be properly\ncompleted and filed with all initial evidence required by applicable regulations and other\nUSCIS instructions. Any evidence submitted in connection with a benefit request is\nincorporated into and considered part of the request.\nIn the RFE, USCIS recognized your submission of a \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" between you\nand the beneficiary. However, the initial record included conflicting information relating to the\nrelationship between you, the beneficiary, and the employers who seek to hire the beneficiary for\nVSCI129VSCPPD0000359679013 of 16www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nrelationship between you, the beneficiary, and the employers who seek to hire the beneficiary for\nservices rendered.\nFor example, in your petition support letter you stated:\nThis letter is in connection with a P-1 A visa petition in which the Petitioner is acting as:\nAn employer with a bona fide job offer, where the Beneficiary will continue working directly in\nher area of extraordinary ability. No third-party authorizations are required for this direct\nemployment.\nThe Petitioner agrees to do the following:\n1. Represent the Beneficiary in activities and events related to trick riding performances\nand competitions within the United States.\n2. Accept service of process on behalf of the Beneficiary.\n3. Arrange reasonable travel accommodations for the Beneficiary if the visa status is\nterminated prematurely.\nThe Petitioner affirms that all information provided in this petition is true and accurate to the\nbest of its knowledge and belief. All involved parties have provided authorization for the\nsubmission of this visa petition.\nAs such, in your petition support letter you claimed to be filing this petition as a U.S. agent performing\nthe function of the employer with \"no third-party authorizations\" required for the \"direct employment\". \nHowever, in the \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" you claimed to be filing the instant petition as a\n\"U.S. Agent for Multiple Employers\".  This agreement further states:\n2. ENGAGEMENT STRUCTURE\nDuring the term of this Agreement, the Beneficiary shall:\nPerform as a specialty act and trick rider at professional rodeos and equestrian events\nlisted in the attached itinerary;\nDeliver contracted performances in accordance with agreements coordinated by IGTA\nwith multiple U.S. rodeo organizations;\nContinued engagements consistent with her extraordinary ability as a PRCA and CPRA\ncarded trick rider.\n3. PETITIONER’S ROLE\nThe Petitioner agrees to:\nAct as USCIS-recognized agent for all U.S.-based engagements;\nMaintain signed or summarized documentation of all performance agreements and oral\ncommitments;\nAccept service of process on behalf of the Beneficiary during the validity period;\nAssist in coordinating lawful appearances in line with the Beneficiary’s skill and\nrecognition in the sport.\nRegarding the beneficiary's compensation the \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" states:\nVSCI129VSCPPD0000359679014 of 16www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nCompensation for each engagement shall be defined by separate agreements with individual\nrodeo promoters and event coordinators. For example, the Beneficiary is scheduled to perform\nat events such as Rodeo Scottsdale, Big Sky Community Rodeo, and Queen Creek Fall Rodeo\nwith compensation of no less than $2500 USD per performance. IGTA maintains records of\nthese engagements in the supporting exhibits.\nThe RFE notified you that regardless of the capacity in which you are filing the instant petition, the\ninitially evidence provided did not satisfy the contract requirement. The RFE explained that\nthe \"Petition and Talent Agreement\" between you and the benefciary was insufficient because this\ndocument is overly vague regarding terms of employment.  While the agreement indicates the\nbeneficiary will earn \"no less than $2500 USD per performance\", the \"Petition and Talent Agreement\"\ndoes not identify the entity responsible for compensating the beneficiary for services\nrendered.  Moreover, the \"Petition and Talent Agreement\" does not adequately detail the terms and\nconditions of the beneficiary's employment at the rodeo events. \nIn response to the RFE you provided a \"Petitioner & Benefciary Agreement\" that was entered into on\nSeptember 3, 2025, as well as \"Specialty Act Contracts\" between the beneficiary and multiple\ncontracting parties that were signed by all parties on September 4, 2025.  USCIS notes that all of the\ncontracts submitted in response to the RFE were entered into after the date you filed the instant petition\nand after the issuance of the RFE. \nRegarding the beneficiary's compensation for her employment, the \"Specialty Act\" contracts include\nvarious performance rates which are inconsistent with the \" $2500 USD per performance\" indicated in\nyour initial petition.  \nTherefore, the evidence submitted with your response to the RFE does not establish that, at the time\nyou filed the instant petition, your petition included a contract detailing the actual terms and conditions\nof the beneficiary's employment during the requested validity period.\nAs explained above, in 8 CFR 103.2(b) a  petitioner must establish eligibility for the requested benefit\nat the time of filing the benefit request.  Further, in is noted in Matter of Michelin Tire Corp., 17 I&N\nDec. 248 (Comm.1978),  the the petitioner must establish eligibility at the time of filing the visa\npetition.  A visa petition may not be approved at a future date after the petitioner or beneficiary\nbecomes eligible under a new set of facts.\nMoreover, the newly claim employment relationship between the beneficiary and her foreign\nemployer, Bell Da Costa Trick Riding, as well as the changes in wages earned by the beneficiary\nappears to be a material change in the the terms and conditions of the beneficiary's employment.  A\npetitioner may not make material corrections to his petition in an effort to make a deficient petition\nconform to USCIS requirements. Matter of Izummi, 22 I&N Dec. 169 (Comm. 1998).\nConsidering the discussion above, the record does not establish the terms and conditions of the\nbeneficiary's employment as claimed in the \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\"  existed at the time you\nfiled the instant petition.  Further, the evidence of record does not establish that the information\ncontained in the \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" are an accurate representation of the beneficiary's\nemployment during the requested validity period.  As such, your petition does not satisfy the\nrequirements of 8 CFR 214.2(p)(2)(ii).\nAgent Petitioner\nThe second issue is that you have not satisfied the requirements for an agent as petitioner.\nTitle 8 CFR 214.2(p)(2)(iv)(E) states:\nAgents as petitioners. A United States agent may file a petition in cases involving workers who\nVSCI129VSCPPD0000359679015 of 16www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nAgents as petitioners. A United States agent may file a petition in cases involving workers who\nare traditionally self-employed or workers who use agents to arrange short-term employment\non their behalf with numerous employers, and in cases where a foreign employer authorizes the\nagent to act on its behalf. A United States agent may be: the actual employer of the beneficiary;\nthe representative of both the employer and the beneficiary; or, a person or entity authorized by\nthe employer to act for, or in place of, the employer as its agent. A petition filed by a United\nStates agent is subject to the following conditions, in relevant part:\n(1) An agent performing the function of an employer must specify the wage offered and\nthe other terms and conditions of employment by contractual agreement with the\nbeneficiary or beneficiaries. The agent/employer must also provide an itinerary of\ndefinite employment and information on any other services planned for the period of\ntime requested.\n(2) A person or company in business as an agent may file the P petition involving\nmultiple employers as the representative of both the employers and the beneficiary or\nbeneficiaries if the supporting documentation includes a complete itinerary of services or\nengagements. The itinerary shall specify the dates of each service or engagement, the\nnames and addresses of the actual employers, the names and addresses of the\nestablishment, venues, or locations where the services will be performed. In questionable\ncases, a contract between the employer(s) and the beneficiary or beneficiaries may be\nrequired. The burden is on the agent to explain the terms and conditions of the\nemployment and to provide any required documentation.\n(3) A foreign employer who, through a United States agent, files a petition for a P\nnonimmigrant alien is responsible for complying with all of the employer sanctions\nprovisions of section 274A of the Act and 8 CFR part 274a. Agent Performing the\nFunctions of an Employer.\nAgents Performing the Function of an Employer\nThe RFE explained that it appeared from the initially submitted evidence that you may be an agent\nperforming the function of an employer in this filing. The RFE notified you to satisfy the conditions\nfor filing as this type of agent you must submit:\nA written contract, or if a written contract does not exist, the summary of the terms of the oral\nagreement that: \nSpecifies the wage offered and other terms of employment; and\nDetails any additional services provided.\nAn itinerary of definite employment and information on any other services planned for the\nperiod of time requested. \nOne of the U.S. agent scenarios that you initially put forward is that you are filing this petition as a\nU.S. agent performing the function of the employer with \"no third-party authorizations\" required for\nthe \"direct employment\".  However, the initially submitted \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" does\nnot establish that the beneficiary will receive remuneration from your agency as the beneficiary’s\nemployer.  Further, the initial record did not contain evidence of any contractual agreement or\nsummary of terms for any future rodeo events establishing that, at the time of filing, your agency has\nnegotiated and arranged any events on the beneficiary’s behalf.\nIn addition, the RFE notified you that the \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" does not provide\nVSCI129VSCPPD0000359679016 of 16www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nIn addition, the RFE notified you that the \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" does not provide\nsufficient details of the terms and conditions of the benefciary's employment. Rather, it appears to be\nan agreement that details the terms of your U.S. agent relationship with the beneficiary and her\nmultiple employers. As such, the \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" does not establish the terms and\nconditions of the beneficiary's employment and does not establish you will be functioning as her\nemployer. \nThe RFE further explained that, in order to satisfy the conditions for filing the petition as a U.S. agent\nperforming the function of the employer, the record must also contain an itinerary of definite\nemployment and information on any other services planned for the period of time requested.  In\nsupport of your petition, you initially provided a \"2025-2028 U.S. Trick Riding Performance\nItinerary\" that lists events occurring monthly during the remainder of 2025. Although the itinerary\nincludes dates and states where the competitions will occur, the RFE notified you that it is incomplete\nand vague. The initially submitted itinerary does not include names and addresses of the locations\nwhich the beneficiary will compete. Itineraries of events and/or engagements must include the names\nand addresses of the entities with whom the beneficiary is contracted to perform the services and the\nnames and addresses of the establishments, venues, or locations where the services will be performed.\nFurther, the \"2025-2028 U.S. Trick Riding Performance Itinerary\" states:\nThis itinerary outlines Bella Da Costa's anticipated performance schedule as a professional\ntrick rider in the United States from 2025 to 2028...\nEvents listed for 2026 through 2028 will follow a similar pattern, with Bella Da Costa \nappearing annually in 8-10 high-profile trick riding events across various U.S. states.\nHowever, USCIS found that the beneficiary's \"anticipated performance schedule\" did not demonstrate\ndefinite employment for the beneficiary as required by regulations. Furthermore, you did not initially\nprovide corroborative documentation that would establish that, at the time of filing, your agency had\nnegotiated entry into the events on the beneficiary’s behalf. \nGiven these deficiencies, the RFE notified you that the \"2025-2028 U.S. Trick Riding Performance\nItinerary\" absent the support of corroborative documentation, did not establish an itinerary of definite\nemployment for the beneficiary.\nIn response to the RFE you now claim that you are now filing the instant petition on behalf of the\nbeneficiary's foreign employer, Bella Da Costa Trick Riding, and provided no additional evidence or\nanalysis regarding your initial claim of filing the instant petition as a U.S. agent performing the\nfunction of an employer.  As such, your petition remains deficient in satisfying the conditions for\nfiling the instant petition as a U.S. agent performing the function of an employer for the reasons\ndiscussed above.  \nMoreover, the newly claim employment relationship between the you, beneficiary and her foreign\nemployer, Bell Da Costa Trick Riding, as well as the changes in wages earned by the beneficiary\nappears to be a material change in the the terms and conditions of the beneficiary's employment and\nyour representation of her.  A petitioner may not make material corrections to his petition in an effort\nto make a deficient petition conform to USCIS requirements. see Matter of Izummi.\nFurther, your response to the RFE included an updated itinerary for the employment period of October\n7, 2025 to October 6, 2026. You also provided \"Specialty Act Contracts\" between the beneficiary and\nmultiple contracting parties that were signed by all parties on September 4, 2025, as evidence of the\nbeneficiary's definite employment.  The newly submitted documentation includes entirely different\nevents and different dates of employment.  Therefore, it does not appear, at the time of filing, the\nrecord included an itinerary of definite employment. \nAs explained above, in 8 CFR 103.2(b) a  petitioner must establish eligibility for the requested benefit\nVSCI129VSCPPD0000359679017 of 16www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nAs explained above, in 8 CFR 103.2(b) a  petitioner must establish eligibility for the requested benefit\nat the time of filing the benefit request.  Further,  the the petitioner must establish eligibility at the time\nof filing the visa petition.  A visa petition may not be approved at a future date after the petitioner or\nbeneficiary becomes eligible under a new set of facts. see Matter of Michelin Tire Corp.\nConsidering the discussion above, the evidence of record does not establish that you satisfied the\nconditions for a U.S. agent performing the function of employer as defined in 8 CFR\n214.2(p)(2)(iv)(E)(1).\nAgents representing both the beneficiary and one or more employers must submit:\nThe RFE explained that the employment described in the \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\",\n appeared to be indicative of a U.S. agent representing the beneficiary and mulitple employers. The\nRFE notified you to satisfy the conditions for filing as this type of agent you must submit:\nEvidence that the agent is authorized to act as an agent on behalf of the beneficiary and all of\nthe entities with whom the beneficiary is contracted to perform the services;\nA complete itinerary of services or engagements that: \nSpecifies the dates of each service or engagement;\nProvides the names and addresses of the entities with whom the beneficiary is contracted\nto perform the services; and\nProvides the names and addresses of the establishments, venues or locations where the\nservices will actually be performed. \nIn the initially submitted \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" you claim to be \"serving in the capacity\nof\" U.S. agent for multiple employers.  The agreement further states:\nWHEREAS, the Beneficiary is internationally recognized as a premier equestrian athlete and\ntrick riding performer with documented appearances at PRCA-sanctioned events and elite\nrodeos across North America;\nWHEREAS, the Beneficiary intends to enter the United States on a temporary basis to perform\nat rodeos, conduct trick riding exhibitions, and engage in media/promotional appearances in\ncoordination with multiple rodeo event organizers...\nAdditionally, \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" further states:\n2. ENGAGEMENT STRUCTURE\nDuring the term of this Agreement, the Beneficiary shall:\nPerform as a specialty act and trick rider at professional rodeos and equestrian events\nlisted in the attached itinerary;\nDeliver contracted performances in accordance with agreements coordinated by IGTA\nwith multiple U.S. rodeo organizations;\nContinued engagements consistent with her extraordinary ability as a PRCA and CPRA\ncarded trick rider.\n3.

While the initial record established you have been\nauthorized to act as the beneficiary's agent, it was not established you have been authorized to act as an\nagent on the behalf of the entities with the entities who seek to hire the beneficiary for services\nrendered.\nFurther, an agent representing the beneficiary and one or more employers is required to submit a\ncomplete itinerary of services or engagements which specifies the dates of each service or\nengagement, the names and addresses of the actual employers, the names and addresses of the\nestablishment, venues, or locations where the services will be performed.  \nIn support of your petition, you provided a \"2025-2028 U.S. Trick Riding Performance Itinerary\" that\nlists events occurring monthly during the remainder of 2025. The RFE notified you that although the\nitinerary includes dates and states where the competitions will occur, it is incomplete and vague. The\nincluded itinerary did not provide names and addresses of the locations which the beneficiary will be\nemployed. Itineraries of events and/or engagements must include the names and addresses of the\nentities with whom the beneficiary is contracted to perform the services and the names and addresses\nof the establishments, venues, or locations where the services will be performed.  Furthermore, the\n\"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" does not indicate who the beneficiary's employers will be when\nengaging in those activities.  \nIn response to the RFE you now claim that you are now filing the instant petition on behalf of the\nbeneficiary's foreign employer, Bella Da Costa Trick Riding, and provided no additional evidence or\nanalysis regarding your initial claim of filing the instant petition as a U.S. agent representing the\nbeneficiary and mulitple employers.  As such, your petition remains deficient in satisfying the\nconditions for filing the instant petition as a U.S. agent representing the beneficiary and mulitple\nemployers for the reasons discussed above.  \nMoreover, the newly claim employment relationship between the you, beneficiary and her foreign\nemployer, Bell Da Costa Trick Riding, as well as the changes in wages earned by the beneficiary\nappears to be a material change in the the terms and conditions of the beneficiary's employment and\nyour representation of her.  A petitioner may not make material corrections to his petition in an effort\nto make a deficient petition conform to USCIS requirements. see Matter of Izummi.\nFurther, your response to the RFE included an updated itinerary for the employment period of October\n7, 2025 to October 6, 2026. You also provided \"Specialty Act Contracts\" between the beneficiary and\nmultiple contracting parties that were signed by all parties on September 4, 2025, as evidence of the\nbeneficiary's employment during the requested validity period.

Although this agent relationship was not\ndiscussed specifically in the RFE, the evidence of record is insufficient to establish that, at the time\nyou filed the instant petition, you satisfied the conditions for filing the instant petition as a U.S. agent\nfiling on behalf of a foreign employer.\nA foreign employer who, through a U.S. agent, files a petition for a P nonimmigrant alien is\nresponsible for complying with all of the employer sanctions provisions of section 274A of the Act\nand 8 CFR part 274a, to include the actual commencement of employment of an employee for wages\nor other remuneration.\nIn response to the RFE you provided a \"Petitioner & Benefciary Agreement\" that was entered into on\nSeptember 3, 2025, as well as an authorization letter from the beneficiary written on September 3,\n2025 and a \"Foreign Employment Terms\" document signed on September 5, 2025.  USCIS notes that\nall of these documents were entered into after the date you filed the instant petition and after the\nissuance of the RFE. \nThe newly claim employment relationship between the you, beneficiary and her foreign employer,\nBell Da Costa Trick Riding, as well as the changes in wages earned by the beneficiary appears to be a\nmaterial change in the the terms and conditions of the beneficiary's employment and your\nrepresentation of the foreign employer.  A petitioner may not make material corrections to his petition\nin an effort to make a deficient petition conform to USCIS requirements. see Matter of Izummi.\nFurther, as explained above, in 8 CFR 103.2(b) a  petitioner must establish eligibility for the requested\nbenefit at the time of filing the benefit request.  Further,  the the petitioner must establish eligibility at\nthe time of filing the visa petition.  A visa petition may not be approved at a future date after the\npetitioner or beneficiary becomes eligible under a new set of facts. see Matter of Michelin Tire Corp.\nFinally, the \"Specialty Act Contracts\" appears to show that the contracting parties will pay the\nbeneficiary directly and not disburse payments to Bella Da Costa Trick Riding.  Payment directly to\nthe beneficiary from the contracting entities undermines your assertion that she will be employed by a\nforeign employer.\nConsidering the discussion above, the evidence of record does not establish that you satisfied the\nconditions for a U.S. agent filing on behalf of a foreign employer as defined in 8 CFR\n214.2(p)(2)(iv)(E)(2).\nBeneficiary Qualifications\nYou indicate the beneficiary qualifies for P-1 non-immigrant status. As defined in statute and\nregulation, a beneficiary may qualify for the P-1A classification as an internationally recognized\nathlete, a professional athlete, an amateur athlete, or as a professional or amateur skater who performs\nindividually or as part of a group in a theatrical ice skating production.\nSection 214(c)(4)(A) of the Act states that for the purposes of section 101(a)(15)(P)(i)(a), an alien is\ndescribed in this subparagraph if the alien-\n(i)(I) performs as an athlete, individually or as part of a group or team, at an internationally\nrecognized level of performance;\nVSCI129VSCPPD00003596790110 of 16www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\n(II) is a professional athlete, as defined in section 204(i)(2);\n(III) performs as an athlete, or as a coach, as part of a team or franchise that is located in the\nUnited States and a member of a foreign league or association of 15 or more amateur sports\nteams, if-- \n(aa) the foreign league or association is the highest level of amateur performance of\nthat sport in the relevant foreign country; \n(bb) participation in such league or association renders players ineligible, whether on\na temporary or permanent basis, to earn a scholarship in, or participate in, that sport\nat a college or university in the United States under the rules of the National\nCollegiate Athletic Association; and \n(cc) a significant number of the individuals who play in such league or association are\ndrafted by a major sports league or a minor league affiliate of such a sports league; or \n(IV) is a professional athlete or amateur athlete who performs individually or as part of a\ngroup in a theatrical ice skating production; \nand\n(ii) seeks to enter the United States temporarily and solely for the purpose of performing—\n(I) as such an athlete with respect to a specific athletic competition; or\n(II) in the case of an individual described in clause (i)(IV), in a specific theatrical ice skating\nproduction or tour.\nAs you do not claim the beneficiary qualifies as an amateur athlete or a professional or amateur skater\nwho performs individually or as a part of a group in a theatrical ice skating production these grounds\nof eligibility will not be discussed further in this denial.\nRequirements for Athletes and Teams\nYou indicate that the beneficiary or team has international recognition. In this situation, the P-1A\nclassification requires an athlete to have an internationally recognized reputation. Alternatively, an\nathlete must be a member of a foreign team that is internationally recognized in the sport. The athlete\nor team must be coming to the United States solely to participate in competitions that have\ndistinguished reputations. Petitions for:\n1. Individual athletes, competing as individuals or on a U.S. team, must show the international\nrecognition is based on their individual accomplishments and that the services to be performed\nrequire an internationally recognized athlete\n2. A team must show that it has achieved international recognition and that the services to be\nperformed require an internationally recognized athletic team. Each member of the team then\nreceives P-1A classification based on the team’s recognition.\nSolely to Compete\nVSCI129VSCPPD00003596790111 of 16www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nThe third issue in this matter is whether the beneficiary is coming to the United States to compete as a\nTrick Rider.\nTitle 8 Code of Federal Regulations (8 CFR), section 214.2(p)(1)(ii)(A) states:\nA P-1 classification applies to an alien who is coming temporarily to the United\nStates:\nTo perform at a specific athletic competition as an athlete, individually or as part of a\ngroup or team, at an internationally recognized level of performance, or\n1.\nTo perform with, or as an integral and essential part of the performance of, an\nentertainment group that has been recognized internationally as being outstanding in\nthe discipline for a sustained and substantial period of time, and who has had a\nsustained and substantial relationship with the group (ordinarily for at least 1 year)\nand provides functions integral to the performance of the group.\n2.\nThe RFE notified you that the evidence you submitted with your petition was insufficient to establish\nthat the beneficiary will be performing (including permissible related/incidental activities) solely as an\nathlete with respect to a specific athletic competition.\nAs explained in the RFE, you did not submit evidence that establishes the specific competition in\nwhich the beneficiary will perform. Rather, you provided a list of \"anticipated events\". \nAs it related to those \"anticipated events\", the \"Roles & Description\"  section of the itinerary indicates\nthat the beneficiary will perform for rodeos in roles such as \"Featured Trick Rider\", \"Specialty Act\", \n\"Headlining Act\", and \"Closing Act\".  The initial record did not establish that these roles are consistent\nwith an athlete competing in an athletic competition.  \nIn addition, the initially submitted itinerary shows that the beneficiary would participate in clinics and\nexpos in roles such as \"Guest Clinician - Filmed Instructional appearances\" at the PRCA Clinic and\nFilming and \"Demo Rider - Educational equestrian showcase\" at the Idaho Horse Expo.  The\ninitial record did not establish that clinics and expos are athletic competitions.  For example, the\nsubmitted articles about the Idaho Horse Expo provides a brief explanation of the event:\nEach year the Idaho Horse Council produces the State’s largest equine EXPO which attracts\nexhibitors and spectators from across the United States. The EXPO features highly regarded\ntrainers and clinicians from across the state and nation, the latest in products ranging from\njewelry to arena equipment, entertainment, industry-related seminars, youth activities, and\ncompetitions from youth roping, to trail events and even jousting.\nThe initial record did not establish the Idaho Horse Expo is a Trick Riding competition or that the\nbeneficiary's participation in the Idaho Horse Expo will be a promotional appearance for her employer\nrelating to a competition. \nFinally, in her initially submitted statement, the beneficiary describes herself as a \"Contract Act\" and\nexplains that she performs acts at rodeos, but does not indicate that she competes in rodeo events.\nIn response to the RFE, you provided multiple \"Specialty Act Contracts\" between the Bella Da Costa\nTrick Riding and contracting parties.  These \"contracts\" show that the beneficiary has entered into an\nagreement with rodeo to perform a Trick Riding act for a fee.  The \"Summary of Oral Terms &\nAthlete Acceptance\" documents further explain that the beneficiary will \"perform specialty trick riding\nroutines\" as a part of rodeos for which see will receive a performance fee. It does not appear the\nbeneficiary is coming to the United States to be a competitor in Trick Riding events.\nVSCI129VSCPPD00003596790112 of 16www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nFurther, the\"Specialty Act Contracts\"between the beneficiary and multiple contracting parties that\nwere signed by all parties on September 4, 2025, as evidence of the beneficiary's definite\nemployment.  The newly submitted documentation includes entirely different events and different\ndates.\nAs explained above, in 8 CFR 103.2(b) a  petitioner must establish eligibility for the requested benefit\nat the time of filing the benefit request.  Further,  the the petitioner must establish eligibility at the time\nof filing the visa petition.  A visa petition may not be approved at a future date after the petitioner or\nbeneficiary becomes eligible under a new set of facts. see Matter of Michelin Tire Corp.\nThe evidence of record does not establish that the beneficiary is coming to the United States to in\nspecific athletic competitions as an athlete.  Therefore, you have not establish that the beneficiary\nis coming to the United States solely for the purpose of competing in a specific athletic competition as\nan athlete. \nInternationally Recognized Level of Competition\nThe fourth issue is whether the beneficiary is coming to the United States to participate in an athletic\ncompetition which has a distinguished reputation and which requires participation of an athlete or\nathletic team that has an international reputation as required in 8 CFR 214.2(p)(4)(ii)(A).\nDescribing the P-1 classification for athletes competing in an individual capacity, 8 CFR\n214.2(p)(4)(i)(A) provides in pertinent part:\nA P-1 classification may be granted to an alien who is an internationally recognized athlete\nbased on his or her own reputation and achievements as an individual. The alien must be\ncoming to the United States to perform services which require an internationally recognized\nathlete.\nAdditionally, 8 CFR section 214.2(p)(4)(ii)(A) states:\nGeneral. A P-1 athlete must have an internationally recognized reputation as an international\nathlete or he or she must be a member of a foreign team that is internationally recognized. The\nathlete or team must be coming to the United States to participate in an athletic competition\nwhich has a distinguished reputation and which requires participation of an athlete or athletic\nteam that has an international reputation.\nThe initial record did not contain corroborative documentation that that would establish that the\nbeneficiary is coming to the United States to participate in an athletic competition which has a\ndistinguished reputation, and which requires participation of an athlete or athletic team that has an\ninternational reputation.\nLastly, 8 CFR section 214.2(p)(4)(ii)(A) states: \nGeneral.  A P-1 athlete must have an internationally recognized reputation as an international\nathlete or he or she must be a member of a foreign team that is internationally recognized.  The\nathlete or team must be coming to the United States to participate in an athletic competition\nwhich has a distinguished reputation and which requires participation of an athlete or athletic\nteam that has an international reputation. \nWith your petition, you submitted various articles about the rodeos in which the beneficiary will\nperform.  However, while these documents provide a general overview of the rodeos, they do not\nsufficiently establish how and/or why the beneficiary's Trick Riding performance is an athletic\ncompetition or a league that has a distinguished reputation and which requires participation of an\nathlete or athletic team that has an international reputation. \nVSCI129VSCPPD00003596790113 of 16www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nFurther, the RFE notified you that the initially submitted itinerary indicates that the beneficiary will\nperform for rodeos in roles such as \"Featured Trick Rider\", \"Specialty Act\",  \"Headlining Act\", and\n\"Closing Act\".  The initial record did not establish that the beneficiary's Trick Riding performances are\nin competitive events at the rodeos.  In addition, the initially submitted itinerary shows that the\nbeneficiary would participate in clinics and expos in roles such as \"Guest Clinician - Filmed\nInstructional appearances\" at the PRCA Clinic and Filming and \"Demo Rider - Educational equestrian\nshowcase\" at the Idaho Horse Expo. Therefore, the initial record does not establish that the\nbeneficiary's roles as explained in the itinerary are consistent with an athlete competing in an athletic\ncompetition or league requires participation of an athlete or athletic team that has an international\nreputation. \nIn response to the RFE, you provided multiple \"Specialty Act Contracts\" between the Bella Da Costa\nTrick Riding and contracting parties.  These \"contracts\" show that the beneficiary has entered into an\nagreement with rodeo to perform a Trick Riding act for a fee.  The \"Summary of Oral Terms &\nAthlete Acceptance\" documents further explain that the beneficiary will \"perform specialty trick riding\nroutines\" as a part of rodeos for which see will receive a performance fee. As explained above, it does\nnot appear the beneficiary is coming to the United States to be a competitor in Trick Riding events.\nFurther, the\"Specialty Act Contracts\"between the beneficiary and multiple contracting parties that\nwere signed by all parties on September 4, 2025, as evidence of the beneficiary's definite\nemployment.  The newly submitted documentation includes entirely different events and different\ndates.\nAs explained above, in 8 CFR 103.2(b) a  petitioner must establish eligibility for the requested benefit\nat the time of filing the benefit request.  Further,  the the petitioner must establish eligibility at the time\nof filing the visa petition.  A visa petition may not be approved at a future date after the petitioner or\nbeneficiary becomes eligible under a new set of facts. see Matter of Michelin Tire Corp.\nConsidering the discussion above, the \"Specialty Act Contracts\" do not establish the beneficiary is\ncoming to the United States to participate in an athletic competition or league that has a distinguished\nreputation and which requires participation of an athlete or athletic team that has an international\nreputation. Accordingly, you have not established that the beneficiary satisfies this requirement.\nTendered Contract\nThe fifth issue is whether you have included a tendered contract with a major United States sports\nleague or team, or a tendered contract in an individual sport commensurate with international\nrecognition in that sport, if such contracts are normally executed in the sport.\nTitle 8 CFR 214.2(p)(4)(ii) (B)(1), which sets forth the documentary requirements for P-1 athletes,\nstates in part that the petition shall include:\nA tendered contract with a major United States sports league or team, or a tendered contract in\nan individual sport commensurate with international recognition in that sport, if such contracts\nare normally executed in the sport.\nAdditionally, the USCIS Policy Manual, Volume 2, Part N, Chapter 4, states that:\nA petition for an athletic team or individual athlete must include a tendered contract with a\n“major United States sports league or team” or tendered contract in an individual sport\ncommensurate with international recognition in that sport, if such contracts are normally\nexecuted in the sport. USCIS interprets “major United States sports league” as a league that has\na distinguished reputation that is commensurate with an internationally recognized level of\nperformance, and “major United States sports team” as a team that participates in such a league,\nconsistent with the statutory standard for internationally recognized athletes.\nVSCI129VSCPPD00003596790114 of 16www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nTherefore, under this interpretation, the league (or the team within the league) may be one where the\nlevel of competition in the league is such that the league (or a team within the league) would not be\nable to remain competitive or maintain its current distinguished reputation in the sport without the\nservices of at least some internationally recognized caliber athletes. \nYou submitted no contracts with the organizing bodies or official invites to any of the events listed in\nthe itinerary with your petition.  Further, the initial record was absent supporting documentation about\nthe events listed on the itinerary that would establish the events' status as internationally recognized\nevents and are considered major United States sports leagues.\nFurther, as explained above, the initially submitted itinerary indicates that the beneficiary would\nperform for rodeos in roles such as \"Featured Trick Rider\", \"Specialty Act\",  \"Headlining Act\", and\n\"Closing Act\".   In addition, the initially submitted itinerary shows that the beneficiary\nwould participate in clinics and expos in roles such as \"Guest Clinician - Filmed Instructional\nappearances\" at the PRCA Clinic and Filming and \"Demo Rider - Educational equestrian showcase\" at\nthe Idaho Horse Expo. \nIn response to the RFE you provided provided multiple \"Specialty Act Contracts\" between the Bella\nDa Costa Trick Riding and contracting parties.  These \"contracts\" show that the beneficiary has\nentered into an agreement with rodeo to perform a Trick Riding act for a fee.  The \"Summary of Oral\nTerms & Athlete Acceptance\" documents further explain that the beneficiary will \"perform specialty\ntrick riding routines\" as a part of rodeos for which see will receive a performance fee. However, as\nexplained above, it does not appear the beneficiary is coming to the United States to be a competitor in\nTrick Riding events.\nFurther, the\"Specialty Act Contracts\"between the beneficiary and multiple contracting parties that\nwere signed by all parties on September 4, 2025, as evidence of the beneficiary's definite\nemployment.  The newly submitted documentation includes entirely different events and different\ndates.\nAs explained above, in 8 CFR 103.2(b) a  petitioner must establish eligibility for the requested benefit\nat the time of filing the benefit request.  Further,  the the petitioner must establish eligibility at the time\nof filing the visa petition.  A visa petition may not be approved at a future date after the petitioner or\nbeneficiary becomes eligible under a new set of facts. see Matter of Michelin Tire Corp.\nTherefore, the evidence of record does not demonstrate that the beneficiary has a tendered contract\nwith a major U.S. sports league or team, or a tendered contract in an individual sport commensurate\nwith international recognition in that sport.\nConclusion\nIn view of the above, the record does not establish:\nThe record includes written contracts between the petitioner and the alien beneficiary or, if\nthere is no written contract, a summary of the terms of the oral agreement under which the\nbeneficiary will be employed as required by Title 8 Code of Federal Regulations (8 CFR)\nsection 214.2(p)(2)(ii);\nYou have satisfied all of the conditions for an: \nAgent functioning as an employer as defined in 8 CFR 214.2(p)(2)(iv)(E)(1); \nAgent representing the beneficiary and multiple employers as defined in 8 CFR\n214.2(p)(2)(iv)(E)(2);\nAgent filing on behalf of a foreign employer as defined in 8 CFR 214.2(p)(2)(iv)(E)(3)\nThe beneficiary is coming to the United States solely for the purpose of performing in a\nspecific athletic competition as an athlete as defined in section 214(c)(4)(A)(ii)(1);\nVSCI129VSCPPD00003596790115 of 16www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

The individual must have sustained national or international acclaim.  The\nindividual's achievements must be in the field of expertise and show that the individual is one of a\nsmall percentage who has risen to the very top of the field.  The individual must be coming to the\nUnited States to continue work in the individual's area of extraordinary ability.\nPursuant to the preponderance of evidence standard, USCIS will examine each piece of evidence for\nrelevance, probative value, and credibility, both individually and within the context of the totality of\nevidence, to determine whether the fact to be proven is probably true.  USCIS comprehensively\nreviews the entire body of evidence before rendering a final determination of eligibility.  Upon review\nof the evidence you submitted in the initial filing, the record contains insufficient documentation to\nestablish the beneficiary meets the regulatory requirements for the O-1A classification. \nTo process your petition and determine if the beneficiary is eligible, additional information is\nrequired.  This request provides suggested evidence that you may submit to satisfy each requested\nitem.  You may:\nSubmit one, some, or all of these items;\nSubmit none of the suggested items and instead submit other evidence to satisfy the request;\nExplain how the evidence in the record already establishes eligibility; and/or\nRequest a decision based on the record. \nNote, however, that you are responsible for providing evidence that best shows that you and the parties\nto this petition meet all requirements.  Evidence must show that all parties were eligible for the\nrequested benefit when you filed Form I-129.\nNote: When submitting additional evidence, please indicate to which individual criterion it applies.  If\nyou choose to submit comparable evidence in lieu of one or more of the criteria below, please indicate\nwhy the criteria you wish to replace do not apply to the occupation.  \nAdditionally, when submitting articles, internet abstracts, and other documentation (excluding\ntestimonial letters) that includes the beneficiary’s name, please highlight the beneficiary’s name.  \nPlease submit evidence that is the most current and is presented in an orderly fashion. Illegible\nphotocopies will not be accepted as valid evidence.\nRequest for Translations\nAll foreign language documents must have a complete English translation to establish eligibility.  This\nincludes any documents you submit in response to this Request for Evidence.  In order for USCIS to\nconsider this evidence, you must submit English language translations for each document.  The\ntranslator must certify that:\nThe translations are accurate and complete; and\nThe translator is competent to translate from the foreign language into English.\nVSCI129VSCPPI0000363173782 of 28www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

If a written contract does not exist, you may\nsubmit a detailed summary of the terms of the oral agreement between the beneficiary and either the\npetitioner or the employer. \nThe contract you submitted is insufficient.\nUSCIS recognizes your submission of a \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" dated August 27, 2025,\nwhich states that the relationship between beneficiary and petitioner is \"U.S. Agent for Foreign\nEmployer who is Self-Employed\".  However, this document contains conflicting terms and conditions\nrelating to the beneficiary's employment and is therefore insufficient in establishing the contract\nrequirement for all O petitions. \nYour contract states the beneficiary is a \"self-employed foreign professional\".  However, you seek to\nhire the beneficiary as a \"World Class Barrel Racer\".

Collaboration with WPRA World Champions\nOngoing working relationship with Brittany Pozzi Tonozzi, three-time WPRA World\nChampion, who personally selected Ms. O’Donoghue-Kent to train and prepare horses\nfor world-level competition (Exhibit 3).

Performance Evaluation for World Champion Riders\nCollaboration with Brittany Pozzi Tonozzi, three-time WPRA World Champion,\nincludes reviewing and adjusting performance plans for elite mounts such as Cashin In\nThe Fame. Montana's input on readiness and competition strategy has directly shaped\ndecisions about which horses to run in high-stakes events like the NFR and Rodeo\nHouston (Exhibits 3, 7, 9).\n3. Futurity and Derby Horse Development\nIn training programs for horses like Proofin Aint Easy, Busy Chasin Proof, and Creed,\nMontana continually evaluates the work of assistant trainers, exercise riders, and other\ncontributors. Her assessments determine whether horses meet the high standards required\nfor entry into restricted futurity and derby races (Exhibits 2, 3).\n4. High-Stakes Pre-Competition Readiness Assessments\nBefore each elite competition, Montana conducts final evaluations to determine if a\nhorse's performance level warrants participation. These assessments function as\ngatekeeping decisions in a high-performance environment where entries are limited and\nstakes are substantial.\nUSCIS recognizes your submission of documentation relating to the beneficiary's work training\nhorses.  However, the submitted evidence does not indicate that the beneficiary's role training\nhorses involved participating as a judge or on a panel that evaluated the work of others in the\nbeneficiary's field of specialization or in an associated field.  You seek to hire the beneficiary as a\n\"World Class Barrel Racer\".  Therefore, the work judged or evaluated by the beneficiary should be that\nof other barrel racers or an associated field.  Training horses does not meet the plain language of\njudging the work of others in the beneficiary's field of specialization or in an associated field.\nMoreover, you state that the beneficiary has conducted performance evaluations for \"World Champion\nRiders\".

Her methods have been validated not\nonly by measurable results — including top placements in multi-million-dollar events — but\nalso by adoption and endorsement from world champion peers and elite owners. This sustained\ninfluence on both individual horses and the broader professional barrel racing community meets\nthe definition of original contributions of major significance.\nTo satisfy this criterion, you submitted multiple testimonial letters from:\nKandace Lumbardy, Unknown occupation;\nJennifer New, Unknown occupation;\nCandy Michaelis, Professional Barrel Racer;\nBrittany Pozzi Tonozzi, World Champion Barrel Racer;\nDr. T.J.

Bobby has gone on to compete successfully at top-level events with me and\ncurrently part of my competition string. Montana laid the foundation for this horse’s success, and it’s\nclear that her training methods are effective at the highest levels of rodeo competition”.  However,\nwhile these statements provide a general overview of the beneficiary’s skills, abilities and\nachievements, and prior work with a specific horse and individual in general terms, the author did not\nspecifically list how and/or why the beneficiary's specific individual contributions resulted in original\nscientific, scholarly, or business-related contributions of major significance in the field.  For example,\nthe author did not submit a sufficiently detailed explanation and/or objective, supporting documentary\nevidence establishing specifically how and/or why the beneficiary's work/individual contributions are\nbeing implemented by others in the field, how and/or why the beneficiary’s work/individual\ncontributions have provoked widespread public commentary, and how and/or why beneficiary has\npatents and/or licensed technology being used by others as a result of their specific contributions or\nother similar supporting evidence establishing how and why the beneficiary's work is an original\ncontribution of major significance in the field of endeavor or how the beneficiary’s work is being\nutilized or implemented by others in the field of endeavor.  To satisfy this criterion, the record must\nnot only establish the beneficiary’s contributions as original or novel, but the record must also show\nthe beneficiary’s contributions to the industry have had a major impact to the field. \nAlthough the authors of the letters claim the beneficiary has made contributions in the field of\nendeavor, the documentation to show that the beneficiary's work is being implemented by others in the\nfield, does not demonstrate that the beneficiary’s work has provoked widespread public commentary,\nand/or that the beneficiary has patents and/or licensed technology being used by others.  Simply\nhaving others cite the beneficiary’s work is insufficient to satisfy this criterion.  Please note, that while\nhaving others in the field cite the beneficiary’s work is noteworthy, it does not establish that work is of\nmajor significance in the field.\nFurthermore, the some authors did not provide a title or list any information regarding their authority,\nexpertise, and knowledge of the beneficiary’s achievements.  While this provides a general overview\nof the beneficiary's skills and abilities and their experience working together, the letters do not contain\nsufficient detail regarding the author’s credentials, the significance of their achievements, or the\ndistinguished reputation of the organizations they represent that would establish they are a recognized\nexpert in the field.\nAdditionally, USCIS acknowledges your submission of statements and supporting documentation\nreferring to media publications having covered the beneficiary and their work.  However, while these\narticles discuss the beneficiary's work and their companies in general terms, the article's do not\nspecifically discuss the beneficiary's individual contributions to their field of expertise and USCIS\nviews these articles as an indirect acknowledgement of the beneficiary's work.  Unless the record\ncontains specific evidence showing the beneficiary’s individual contributions lead to wide-spread use,\nimplementation, or commentary, having prior work cited in a media article indirectly is insufficient in\nestablishing eligibility under this criterion.

They should explain, in detail, how the contribution was\n\"original\" (not merely replicating the work of others) and how they were of \"major\"\nsignificance.  General statements regarding the importance of the endeavors may be insufficient.\nScholarly Articles \nYou may submit evidence of the beneficiary's authorship of scholarly articles in the field, in\nprofessional journals or other major media (including electronic media).\nYou did not submit any evidence for this option.

See 8 CFR 214.2(o)(3)(iii)(B)(7).\nTherefore, you must submit evidence that 1. The beneficiary was employed by the organizations or\nestablishments 2. That the beneficiary’s role was critical or essential, and 3. That those organizations\nor establishments have a distinguished reputation.\nYour included support letter references the following as supporting evidence submitted under this\ncriterion:\nOngoing and prior engagements with world champion riders (e.g., Brittany Pozzi Tonozzi), elite\nhorse breeders, and major rodeo event organizations, where her expertise was integral to\ncompetitive success (Exhibits 2, 3, 7, 12).\nFurthermore, your support letter references the beneficiary's role in \"Collaboration with WPRA World\nChampion Brittany Pozzi Tonozzi\", \"Exclusive Training Engagements or Elite Horse Owners\",\n\"Collegiate Rodeo Program Impact\", \"High-Profile Event Teams\".  As stated above, to meet the plain\nlanguage of this criterion, you must submit evidence that the beneficiary was actually an employee of\nan or establishment.  You have not provided sufficient, objective supporting documentation\nestablishing the beneficiary’s employment with any of the listed organizations or establishments.\nMoreover, as stated above, to meet the plain language of this criterion you must establish that the\nbeneficiary was employed by organizations or establishments.  USCIS recognizes your statements and\nsupporting evidence relating to the beneficiary’s role with various individuals and/or \"Event teams\". \nHowever, you have not established that these are organizations or establishments per the plain\nlanguage definition.  Simply working with an individual or group, without providing sufficient\nsupporting evidence indicating that the beneficiary was an employee with an organization or\nestablishment with a distinguished reputation is insufficient in meeting the plain language requirements\nof this criterion.\nIn addition, your support letter repeatedly references submitted \"contracts\".  For example, you state\nthat the beneficiary has \"ongoing and prior engagements\" with organizations such as \"major world\nrodeo organizations\".  However, you submitted no contracts relating to the beneficiary's prior\nemployment with your filing. \nYou may still submit evidence to satisfy this criterion. \nEvidence may include, but is not limited to, documentation that establishes the beneficiary's\nemployment in a critical capacity with an organization or establishment that has a distinguished\nreputation.\nVSCI129VSCPPI00003631737819 of 28www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

You may still submit evidence to satisfy it.\nThe evidence to establish whether the beneficiary's compensation is high relative to others working in\nthe field may take many forms.  Examples may include but are not limited to:\nCopies of contracts or similar reliable evidence;\nDocuments showing the beneficiary received a high salary, or other significant forms of\ncompensation, for services in comparison to others in the field, which may include equity in\nlieu of cash;\nA statistical comparison of the salaries in the beneficiary's field from a government or private\ninstitution or a similar organization.  This should show that the beneficiary commanded a high\nsalary, or other significantly high remuneration, for services compared to others in the field;\nGeographical or position-appropriate compensation surveys and organizational justifications to\npay above the compensation data;\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS): http://www.bls.gov/bls/blswage.htm; \nThe Department of Labor's Career One Stop website: \nhttp://www.careeronestop.org/SalariesBenefits/Sal_default.aspx;\nThe Department of Labor's Office of Foreign Labor Certification Online Wage Library: \nhttp://www.flcdatacenter.com;\nTestimony from industry experts; and\nOther corroborative evidence showing that the wage rate is high relative to others working in\nthe field.\nNote:  U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) prevailing wage rate information alone does not\ngenerally establish a salary or other remuneration is \"significantly\" higher than others in the\nfield.  If you submit DOL prevailing wage rate information, you should submit additional\nevidence showing that the wage rate is high relative to others working in the field (such as the\nexamples above).\nComparable Evidence\nIf the preceding achievement criteria did not readily apply to the beneficiary's occupation, you may\nsubmit comparable evidence to establish the beneficiary's eligibility.  You should indicate why the\ncriteria do not apply to the occupation. \nYou submitted comparable evidence. \nMoreover, 8 CFR 214.2(o)(3)(iii)(C) states the following relating to comparable evidence:\nIf the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(iii) of this section do not readily apply to the beneficiary's\noccupation, the petitioner may submit comparable evidence in order to establish the\nbeneficiary's eligibility\nYour support letter states the following relating to the beneficiary’s eligibility under comparable\nevidence:\nComparable Evidence Provision\nUnder 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(o)(3)(v), where the field does not readily offer traditional award\nstructures, the Petitioner may submit comparable evidence that demonstrates the beneficiary’s\nVSCI129VSCPPI00003631737820 of 28www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

Your support letter references the\nfollowing:\nEvidence Provided\nMontana Gaye O’Donoghue-Kent’s career features consistent recognition at the most elite\nlevels of professional barrel racing, a field where success is measured by performance in\nhigh-stakes, restricted-entry competitions with substantial prize purses.

As such, the criterion relating to awards, aka prize purses,\nappears to directly relate to the beneficiary's field of expertise. \nMoreover, you state that the beneficiary has conducted performance evaluations for \"World Champion\nRiders\"\nFurthermore, a search of publicly available records indicates that barrel racing standings/rankings are\nearned to determine a \"World Champion Barrel Racer\" from \"WPRA approved barrel races only\".  For\nexample, the World Professional Rodeo Association's (WPRA) website states the following:\nWPRA pro rodeo standings have been organized to determine the World Champion Barrel\nRacer.

Selection and Approval of Competition Horses for Elite Owners\nMs. O’Donoghue-Kent is entrusted by leading owners such as Rylan Heller and Jennifer\nNew to evaluate, select, and prepare horses for million-dollar barrel racing events,\nincluding the Pink Buckle and Ruby Buckle series (Exhibits 2, 3, 12).\nThis role requires expert assessment of a horse's athletic ability, temperament, and\nVSCI129VSCPPI00003631737824 of 28www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

Performance Evaluation for World Champion Riders\nCollaboration with Brittany Pozzi Tonozzi, three-time WPRA World Champion,\nincludes reviewing and adjusting performance plans for elite mounts such as Cashin In\nThe Fame. Montana's input on readiness and competition strategy has directly shaped\ndecisions about which horses to run in high-stakes events like the NFR and Rodeo\nHouston (Exhibits 3, 7, 9).\n3. Futurity and Derby Horse Development\nIn training programs for horses like Proofin Aint Easy, Busy Chasin Proof, and Creed,\nMontana continually evaluates the work of assistant trainers, exercise riders, and other\ncontributors. Her assessments determine whether horses meet the high standards required\nfor entry into restricted futurity and derby races (Exhibits 2, 3).\n4. High-Stakes Pre-Competition Readiness Assessments\nBefore each elite competition, Montana conducts final evaluations to determine if a\nhorse's performance level warrants participation. These assessments function as\ngatekeeping decisions in a high-performance environment where entries are limited and\nstakes are substantial.\nYour statements appear to assert that the criterion relating to serving as a judge or on a panel that\nevaluated the work of others evaluating work in the beneficiary's field of specialization or in an\nassociated field, as described under 8 CFR 214.2(o)(3)(iii)(B)(4), does not readily apply to the\nbeneficiary’s field of expertise.\nPlease note, the citation provided, \"8 C.F.R. § 214.2(o)(3)(v)\", refers to evidentiary criteria for an alien\nof extraordinary achievement in the motion picture or television industry, which does not apply to the\nclassification being sought in this petition.\nWhile you state that the beneficiary's field of expertise is a field where \"where judging does not take\nplace in a formal, public panel format\", publicly available records and your own statements directly\ncontradict that assertion.  For example, the submitted evidence states that \"Montana continually\nevaluates the work of assistant trainers, exercise riders, and other contributors\".  Moreover, you state\nthat the beneficiary has conducted performance evaluations for \"World Champion Riders\". \nAdditionally, the Wikipedia entry for “Barrel Racing” states the following relating to judges:\nThe main purpose of barrel racing is to run a set pattern as fast as possible. The times are\nmeasured either by an electric eye, a device using a laser system to record times, or by a judge\nwho drops a flag to let the timer know when to start and stop the clock. Judges and timers are\nmore commonly seen in local and non-professional events. The timer begins when horse and\nrider cross the starting line, and ends when the barrel pattern has been successfully executed\nand horse and rider cross the finish line. Success depends on several factors, most commonly\nthe horse's physical and mental condition, the rider's horsemanship abilities, and the type of\nground or footing (the quality, depth, content, etc. of the sand or dirt in the arena).\nBarrel Racing, Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_racing.

You\nhave not submitted sufficient evidence establishing how and/or why the submitted evidence meets the\nregulatory requirements relating to comparable evidence. \nAdditionally, your support letter states the following relating to the beneficiary’s eligibility under\ncomparable evidence:\nComparable Evidence Provision\nUnder 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(O)(3)(v), where contributions are not publicly documented in\ntraditional academic or technical publications, comparable evidence may include innovations,\ntechniques, and professional results that have materially advanced the field and been adopted\nby top-tier practitioners.\nYour statements appear to assert that the criterion relating to beneficiary’s original scientific, scholarly,\nor business-related contributions of major significance in the field, as described under, 8 CFR\n214.2(o)(3)(iii)(B)(5), does not readily apply to the beneficiary’s field of expertise.\nPlease note, the citation provided, \"8 C.F.R. § 214.2(o)(3)(v)\", refers to evidentiary criteria for an alien\nof extraordinary achievement in the motion picture or television industry, which does not apply to the\nclassification being sought in this petition.\nAdditionally, your included support letter references the following as supporting evidence submitted\nunder this criterion:\nTraining methods producing multiple championship-caliber horses, including Cashin In The\nFame, now competing at the top levels with WPRA world champions; development of horses\nfor restricted-entry, multi-million-dollar events (Exhibits 2, 7, 9, 20).\nUSCIS recognizes your submission of statements and supporting evidence relating to comparable\nevidence submitted for criterion 8 CFR 214.2(o)(3)(iii)(B)(5).  However, your own statements\nindicate that this criterion readily applies to the beneficiary's occupation.  You state that the\nbeneficiary has developed \"Training methods producing multiple championship-caliber horses\", which\nyou state are now being used \"at the top levels with WPRA world champions\".  Therefore, this\ncriterion appears to readily apply to the beneficiary's occupation and the deficiencies under that\ncriterion are listed above. \nAdditionally, your support letter states the following relating to the beneficiary’s eligibility under\ncomparable evidence:\nComparable Evidence Provision\nUnder 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(o)(3)(v), in fields where organizational prestige is tied to individual\ncompetitive success rather than corporate structure, comparable evidence may show the\nbeneficiary’s critical role in producing results for distinguished individuals, teams, or\ncompetitive programs.\nYour statements appear to assert that the criterion relating to beneficiary’s in a critical or essential\ncapacity for organizations and establishments that have distinguished reputations, as outlined under 8\nCFR 214.2(o)(3)(iii)(B)(7), does not readily apply to the beneficiary’s field of expertise.\nPlease note, the citation provided, \"8 C.F.R. § 214.2(o)(3)(v)\", refers to evidentiary criteria for an alien\nof extraordinary achievement in the motion picture or television industry, which does not apply to the\nclassification being sought in this petition.\nAdditionally, your included support letter references the following as supporting evidence submitted\nunder this criterion:\nVSCI129VSCPPI00003631737826 of 28www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

However, your own statements\nindicate that this criterion readily applies to the beneficiary's occupation.  You state that the\nbeneficiary has \"ongoing and prior engagements\" with organizations such as \"major world rodeo\norganizations\".  Therefore, this criterion appears to readily apply to the beneficiary's occupation and\nthe deficiencies under that criterion are listed above. \nFurthermore, to establish the beneficiary’s eligibility with comparable evidence, you must establish\nthat the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(iii) of this section do not readily apply to the beneficiary's\noccupation.  You have submitted statements and supporting evidence both arguing eligibility under\neach of the referenced criterion and also for comparable evidence.  Your own statements argue both\nthat the criterion apply and that they also do not.  As such, you have not established that the referenced\neligibility criterion does not readily apply to the beneficiary’s eligibility.  Simply having insufficient\nevidence to establish the eligibility requirements in a specific criterion that readily applies to the\nbeneficiary’s field/occupation does not satisfy the regulatory requirements for comparable evidence\nsubmission.\nYou may still submit comparable evidence if you indicate which of the criteria do not readily apply to\nthe beneficiary's occupation.\nWhen submitting comparable evidence, you should:\nExplain how the regulatory criteria are not applicable to the beneficiary's occupation; and\nExplain why the evidence you submitted is \"comparable\" to the applicable regulatory\nrequirement.\nPLACE THE ATTACHED COVERSHEET AND THIS ENTIRE LETTER ON TOP OF YOUR\nRESPONSE.

The individual must have sustained national or international acclaim.  The\nindividual's achievements must be in the field of expertise and show that the individual is one of a\nsmall percentage who has risen to the very top of the field.  The individual must be coming to the\nUnited States to continue work in the individual's area of extraordinary ability.\nPursuant to the preponderance of evidence standard, USCIS will examine each piece of evidence for\nrelevance, probative value, and credibility, both individually and within the context of the totality of\nevidence, to determine whether the fact to be proven is probably true.  USCIS comprehensively\nreviews the entire body of evidence before rendering a final determination of eligibility.  Upon review\nof the evidence you submitted in the initial filing, the record contains insufficient documentation to\nestablish the beneficiary meets the regulatory requirements for the O-1A classification. \nTo process your petition and determine if the beneficiary is eligible, additional information is\nrequired.  This request provides suggested evidence that you may submit to satisfy each requested\nitem.  You may:\nSubmit one, some, or all of these items;\nSubmit none of the suggested items and instead submit other evidence to satisfy the request;\nExplain how the evidence in the record already establishes eligibility; and/or\nRequest a decision based on the record. \nNote, however, that you are responsible for providing evidence that best shows that you and the parties\nto this petition meet all requirements.  Evidence must show that all parties were eligible for the\nrequested benefit when you filed Form I-129.\nNote: When submitting additional evidence, please indicate to which individual criterion it applies.  If\nyou choose to submit comparable evidence in lieu of one or more of the criteria below, please indicate\nwhy the criteria you wish to replace do not apply to the occupation.  \nAdditionally, when submitting articles, internet abstracts, and other documentation (excluding\ntestimonial letters) that includes the beneficiary’s name, please highlight the beneficiary’s name.  \nPlease submit evidence that is the most current and is presented in an orderly fashion. Illegible\nphotocopies will not be accepted as valid evidence.\nIn addition to demonstrating the beneficiary’s extraordinary ability and recognition in the field, a\npetitioner must demonstrate that an O-1A or O-1B (Arts) beneficiary is coming to the United States to\ncontinue work in the “area of extraordinary ability.”  There is no statutory or regulatory definition of\nthe term “field” or the phrase “area of extraordinary ability.” For purposes of evaluating an O-1A or\nO-1B (Arts) beneficiary’s extraordinary ability in the field, USCIS interprets the term “field” to allow\nconsideration of acclaim and recognition for achievements in multiple related occupations (that is,\nthose involving shared skillsets, knowledge, or expertise). Similarly, in the O-1A or O-1B (Arts)\ncontext, USCIS interprets the phrase “area of extraordinary ability” broadly to include not only the\nspecific occupation(s) in which the beneficiary has garnered acclaim, but also other occupations that\nVSCI129VSCPPI0000364407852 of 21www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nspecific occupation(s) in which the beneficiary has garnered acclaim, but also other occupations that\ninvolve shared skillsets, knowledge, or expertise.\nField of Endeavor\nThe duties of a race car driver and a \"Motorsport Crew Chief and Setup Specialist\" involve two\ncompletely different skillsets and have completely different duties.  The majority of the evidence\nsubmitted relates to the beneficiary's career as a driver.  The evidence in the record is insufficient to\nestablish that the occupation of driver sufficiently shares skillsets, knowledge, or expertise with that of\n\"Motorsport Crew Chief and Setup Specialist\".  Therefore, the record does not show the occupation of\n\"Motorsport Crew Chief and Setup Specialist\" to be within the beneficiary’s field or area of\nextraordinary ability.\nIf you would like USCIS to consider evidence of the beneficiary’s ability and experience as a driver in\nrelation to a \"Motorsport Crew Chief and Setup Specialist\", you may submit evidence that the\noccupations share skillsets, knowledge, or expertise.\nRelevant evidence may include but is not limited to evidence that:\nThe occupations are in the same industry or are otherwise related based on shared duties or\nexpertise;\nOne occupation is a supervisory, management, or other leadership position that oversees the\nbeneficiary’s previous positions or otherwise requires shared knowledge, skills, or expertise;\nIt is common for persons in one occupation to transition to the other occupation(s) based upon\ntheir experience and knowledge.\nRequest for Translations\nAll foreign language documents must have a complete English translation to establish eligibility.  This\nincludes any documents you submit in response to this Request for Evidence.  In order for USCIS to\nconsider this evidence, you must submit English language translations for each document.  The\ntranslator must certify that:\nThe translations are accurate and complete; and\nThe translator is competent to translate from the foreign language into English.\nGeneral Requirements for All O-1A Nonimmigrant Petitions \nIn general, petitions seeking O nonimmigrant classification must include: \nCopies of contracts;\nA description of the competition(s), event(s), or performance(s); and\nAt least one consultation. \nTo satisfy these requirements, you submitted: \nForm I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker;\nForm I-129, O and P Classifications Supplement to Form I-129;\nPetitioner support letter;\nTestimonial letter(s) and supporting documentation;\nAwards supporting documentation;\nVSCI129VSCPPI0000364407853 of 21www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

If a written contract does not exist, you may\nsubmit a detailed summary of the terms of the oral agreement between the beneficiary and either the\npetitioner or the employer. \nThe contracts you submitted are insufficient.\nYou submitted a \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" between you and the beneficiary indicating you\nwill be representing the beneficiary as agent with the various employers who wish to employ the\nbeneficiary during the requested validity period.  This document states the following:\nWhereas, the Primary Employer, Keith Kunz Motorsports (KKM), is a U.S. organization of\ndistinguished reputation that competes in the USAC National Midget Championship and\nPOWRi National Series, and has engaged the Beneficiary to perform technical and competitive\nservices essential to its national racing program;\nWhereas, IGTA will also coordinate additional engagements with secondary U.S. employers,\nincluding affiliated racing teams, sponsors, or event organizers, for activities within the scope\nof the Beneficiary’s extraordinary ability;\nIn addition, this document states the following under \"Direct by Agent Activities\":\nActivities organized, managed, or facilitated by the Petitioner in its capacity as U.S. Agent for\nMultiple Employers, where IGTA maintains administrative control and ensures regulatory\ncompliance.\nCoordination of engagements for KKM and other sanctioned teams or sponsors.\nScheduling participation in driver development programs, mechanical workshops, and\nsponsor showcases.\nOversight of compensation, contracts, and itinerary alignment for each approved\nengagement.\nMoreover, this document states the following under \"Self-Employment Activities\":\nSelf-Employment Activities\nActivities undertaken by the Beneficiary that fall within the scope of his extraordinary ability\nbut require oversight by IGTA to ensure O-1A compliance.\nTechnical consulting for U.S. teams or sponsors seeking specialized chassis setup or\ndata-driven performance improvements.\nInstructional seminars or engineering workshops organized by IGTA.\nOccasional consulting engagements with sanctioning bodies or affiliated U.S. motorsport\nacademies.\nVSCI129VSCPPI0000364407854 of 21www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

These include, but are not limited to:\nKeith Kunz Motorsports (Primary Employer) - Serving as Crew Chief and Setup\nSpecialist for all national racing events, off-season testing, and technical development\nprograms.\nSecondary Racing Teams - Providing setup support, engineering consultation, or crew\nservices for select events approved by IGTA and within the terms of O-1 authorization.\nSponsors and Promotional Entities - Participating in sponsor activations, media\ninterviews, and trade-show exhibitions related to motorsports engineering or\nperformance.\nEducational or Development Programs - Assisting in youth or collegiate training\nworkshops, driver-mechanic mentorship sessions, or public appearances coordinated by\nIGTA.\nOther Approved U.S. Organizations - Engaging in track-side technical support or\nconsulting assignments that align with the beneficiary’s field of extraordinary ability.\nAdditionally, USCIS recognizes your submission of a \"Multiple Employer Agreement For O-1A Visa\nBeneficiary\" between the beneficiary and Keith Kunz Motorsports (KKM).  This document states the\nfollowing:\n6. AUTHORIZATION FOR SERVICE OF PROCESS\nThe Employer grants permission for the Petitioner, IGTA, to act as the authorized U.S. Agent\nfor the Beneficiary and to receive service of process on behalf of both the Beneficiary and all\nemployers involved in this petition.\n7. AGENT-BASED PETITION FILING\nThe Employer authorizes IGTA to file the O-1A petition on behalf of the Beneficiary and all\nparticipating employers, including the coordination of immigration documentation, itinerary\nmanagement, and compliance reporting for the duration of the engagement.\nFurthermore, under \"Description of Authorized Activities\" this agreements lists \"Participation in\npublic relations and promotional activities associated with KKM and other authorized employers\nunder this petition.\nYou state the beneficiary will be working with multiple employers over the course of the requested\nvalidity period, performing functions such as providing setup support, engineering consultation, or\ncrew services for \"secondary racing teams\", participating in sponsor activations, media interviews, and\ntrade-show exhibitions, assisting in youth or collegiate training workshops, driver-mechanic\nmentorship sessions, or public appearances, engaging in track-side technical support or consulting\nassignments, etc.  However, you provided no contracts from any other employer, outlining the terms\nand conditions of the beneficiary's employment, other than the beneficiary's work with KKM.  As\nsuch, you have not satisfied the regulatory requirements relating to O petitions and contracts. \nIf the information you provide does not support approval of the full validity period requested, the\nperiod granted will be based on the evidence provided, which may be a limited validity period. \nWritten contracts, or the summary of the terms of an oral agreement, must specify the terms and\nVSCI129VSCPPI0000364407855 of 21www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

They must: \nSpecify the wage offered and explain the terms and conditions under which the beneficiary will\nperform these services; and\nDetail any additional services provided. \nAgents\nPetitions for O-1A nonimmigrants may be filed by a: \nU.S. employer;\nU.S. agent; or\nA foreign employer through a U.S. agent. \nU.S. Agents\nIt appears that you are a U.S. agent.  You must provide evidence to establish the relationship between\nyou and the relevant parties, showing that you: \nPerform the function of an employer;\nRepresent the beneficiary and multiple employers with whom the beneficiary is contracted to\nwork; or\nRepresent a foreign employer. \nAgents performing the function of an employer must submit: \nA written contract (or if a written contract does not exist, a summary of the terms of the oral\nagreement) between you and the beneficiary that: \nSpecifies the wage offered and other terms of employment; and\nDetails any additional services provided.\nAnd\nAn itinerary of employment and information on any other services planned for the intended\nemployment dates. \nAgents representing both the beneficiary and one or more employers must submit: \nEvidence that the agent is authorized to act as an agent on behalf of the beneficiary and all of\nthe entities with whom the beneficiary is contracted to perform the services;\nContracts between the beneficiary and the entities with whom the beneficiary will perform\nservices, explaining the terms and conditions of employment; and\nA complete itinerary of services or engagements that: \nSpecifies the dates of each service or engagement;\nProvides the names and addresses of the entities with whom the beneficiary is contracted\nto perform the services; and\nProvides the names and addresses of the establishments, venues, or locations where the\nservices will be performed. \nThe evidence you submitted is insufficient.\nUSCIS recognizes your submission of statements indicating that the \"Petitioner Employment\nStructure\" is \"U.S. Agent for Multiple Employers\".

A United States agent may be:  The actual employer of the beneficiary, the\nrepresentative of both the employer and the beneficiary; or, a person or entity authorized by the\nemployer to act for, or in place of, the employer as its agent.  A petition filed by an agent is\nsubject to the following conditions: \nAn agent performing the function of an employer must provide the contractual\nagreement between the agent and the beneficiary which specifies the wage\noffered and the other terms and conditions of employment of the beneficiary.\n1.\nA person or company in business as an agent may file the petition involving\nmultiple employers as the representative of both the employers and the\nbeneficiary, if supporting documentation includes a complete itinerary of the\nevent or events.  The itinerary must specify the dates of each service or\nengagement, the names and addresses of the actual employers, and the names\nand addresses of the establishments, venues, or locations where the services will\nbe performed.  A contract between the employers and the beneficiary is\nrequired.

He has also received multiple peer-voted awards, including the Auckland TQ Drivers\nChoice Award and the ATQMA President’s Award (Exhibits 4, 6, 22-24).\nFurthermore, your support letter also states:\n2. Championship-Winning Technical Program Development\n(Exhibits 4, 6, 22 & 23)\nMr. Cooke’s engineering leadership at Cooke Motorsport culminated in the team’s victory at\nthe 2025 New Zealand TQ Midget Grand Prix, the country’s top national championship\n(Exhibits 6 & 23).\nAs both Crew Chief and primary setup engineer, he designed the car’s chassis geometry and\ntire strategy that delivered sustained front-running performance and eventual victory.\nThis accomplishment reflects not only competitive excellence but also a demonstrable technical\ninnovation: his proprietary setup model successfully balanced mechanical grip and tire wear on\nhigh-degradation tracks, a breakthrough cited in support letters as a benchmark for other teams.\nYou state the beneficiary's role in the \"2025 New Zealand TQ Midget Grand Prix\" was as \"Crew Chief\nand primary setup engineer\".  However, you submitted statements indicating that the beneficiary is the\nreigning New Zealand TQ Midget Grand Prix Champion (2025), presumably as the driver. \nFurthermore, you submitted a media article from \"Nelson App\" which you reference above under\nexhibit 22, which states the following:\nSix-time NZ Champion Jeremy Webb sat behind the lead car of Dylan Cooke, but on lap 21 his\nrear wheel detached leaving him parked on the infield. It moved Morgan up to 2nd spot on the\nrestart, but the Kihikihi driver was dominating the race as the field battled for the minor\nplacings.\nThe submitted evidence appears to indicate that the beneficiary won this award as a racecar driver, not\nas \"Crew Chief and primary setup engineer\", which you allege.  You may wish to submit a detailed\nresponse for this discrepancy with your return to this request.  Furthermore, this casts doubt on your\nstatements and supporting evidence submitted relating to the beneficiary's eligibility under this criterion.\nDoubt cast upon any aspect of the petitioner’s evidence may lead to a reevaluation of the reliability\nand sufficiency of the remaining evidence offered in support of the visa petition.  See Matter of Ho, 19\nI&N Dec. 582 (BIA 1988).\nFurthermore, this appears to be an award for placing in a racing competition as a driver.

Please note that requirements that\nonly include employment or activity in a field; minimum education, experience, or achievement;\nrecommendations by colleagues or current members; or payment of dues do not satisfy this criterion\nsince these requirements do not constitute outstanding achievements.\nUSCIS recognizes your submission of statements and evidence relating to the beneficiary's role with\nthe listed groups.  However, you did not submit any supporting evidence establishing that these groups\nare associations which grant \"membership\" and you did not submit evidence establishing that the\nbeneficiary holds \"membership” in those listed associations\nAdditionally, you did not submit evidence that membership in this association is granted after an\nevaluation of their achievements having been judged by recognized national or international experts in\nidentified disciplines or fields. \nFurthermore, you seek to hire the beneficiary as a \"Motorsport Crew Chief and Setup Specialist\".  You\nstate that the beneficiary has \"extraordinary ability and sustained national and international acclaim in\nthe field of motorsport performance and engineering\".  All of the submitted membership material\nrelates to midget race car drivers.  You did not submit any membership material relating to the\nbeneficiary's work as a \"Motorsport Crew Chief and Setup Specialist\".

See 8 CFR\n214.2(o)(3)(iii)(B)(3).  Any individual can post on any topic on social media websites without any\nmedia publication process.  As such, social media postings do not represent published material in a\nmajor media source as required by regulation.  Therefore, this evidence is insufficient in establishing\nthe beneficiary’s eligibility under this criterion.\nFurthermore, you seek to hire the beneficiary as a \"Motorsport Crew Chief and Setup Specialist\".  All\nof the submitted material relates to the beneficiary's midget driving career.  You did not submit any\npublished material relating to the beneficiary's work as a \"Motorsport Crew Chief and Setup\nSpecialist\".  Therefore, this evidence does not meet the plain language of this criterion as it does not\ninclude published material relating to the beneficiary’s work in the field for which classification is\nsought.  \nYou may still submit evidence to satisfy this criterion. \nEvidence may include, but is not limited to, documentation that:\nEstablishes the significance of the published material;\nIdentifies the beneficiary as a person who has risen to the very top of the field of endeavor;\nEstablishes the significance of the published material and identifies the name of the publication;\nEstablishes that the published material has local, national, or international circulation;\nEstablishes the frequency of publication, including the number of copies provided for\ncirculation; and\nEstablishes the source (web address) and date material was electronically published.\nJudging the Work of Others \nYou may submit evidence showing the beneficiary has participated as a judge or on a panel that\nevaluated the work of others.

His work has been adopted by multiple\nteams and credited with measurable performance improvements (Exhibits 4, 7, 7b). \nTo satisfy this criterion, you submitted multiple testimonial letters from:\nKayden Barker, Kayden Barker Motorsport; and\nJustin Insley, JI Fabrication, Michael Pickens Racing. \nYou have provided documentary evidence indicating that people in the field of endeavor consider the\nbeneficiary's work important. \nWhile the testimonial letters attest the beneficiary is an extraordinary individual, who has made\noriginal, significant, or novel contributions to the field, the evidence in the record does not support\nthese claims.  The letters lack specific details of how and why the beneficiary's work is an original\ncontribution of major significance in the field of endeavor or how the beneficiary’s work is being\nutilized or implemented by others in the field of endeavor. \nFor example, the testimonial letter from Kayden Barker, Kayden Barker Motorsport, states the\nfollowing:\nTo whom it may concern\nI am writing this testimonial letter for Dylan Cooke.\nI have known Dylan for over 5 years, throughout knowing Dylan his outstanding knowledge\nand ability has been of great value to my race team.\nDylan has spent time within my race program, working on week-to-week setups and general\nwork to my car, Dylan has a great understanding of how race cars preform [sic].

Dylan is extremely talented at maximising [sic] a race\ncars performance through the use of his unique knowledge, in my opinion he would be a massive asset\nto any race team”.  However, while these statements provide a general overview of the beneficiary’s\nwork with one individual, and the beneficiary's skills and abilities, the author did not specifically list\nhow and/or why the beneficiary's specific individual contributions resulted in original scientific,\nscholarly, or business-related contributions of major significance in the field.  For example, the author\ndid not submit a sufficiently detailed explanation and/or objective, supporting documentary evidence\nestablishing specifically how and/or why the beneficiary's work/individual contributions are being\nimplemented by others in the field, how and/or why the beneficiary’s work/individual contributions\nhave provoked widespread public commentary, and how and/or why beneficiary has patents and/or\nlicensed technology being used by others as a result of their specific contributions or other similar\nsupporting evidence establishing how and why the beneficiary's work is an original contribution of\nmajor significance in the field of endeavor or how the beneficiary’s work is being utilized or\nimplemented by others in the field of endeavor.  To satisfy this criterion, the record must not only\nestablish the beneficiary’s contributions as original or novel, but the record must also show the\nbeneficiary’s contributions to the industry have had a major impact to the field. \nAdditionally, for example, the testimonial letter from Justin Insley, JI Fabrication, Michael Pickens\nRacing, states the following:\nVSCI129VSCPPI00003644078515 of 21www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

However, while these statements provide a general overview of the\nbeneficiary’s work with one individual, and the beneficiary's skills and abilities abilities, the author did\nnot specifically list how and/or why the beneficiary's specific individual contributions resulted in\noriginal scientific, scholarly, or business-related contributions of major significance in the field.  For\nexample, the author did not submit a sufficiently detailed explanation and/or objective, supporting\ndocumentary evidence establishing specifically how and/or why the beneficiary's work/individual\ncontributions are being implemented by others in the field, how and/or why the beneficiary’s\nwork/individual contributions have provoked widespread public commentary, and how and/or\nwhy beneficiary has patents and/or licensed technology being used by others as a result of their\nspecific contributions or other similar supporting evidence establishing how and why the beneficiary's\nwork is an original contribution of major significance in the field of endeavor or how the beneficiary’s\nwork is being utilized or implemented by others in the field of endeavor.  To satisfy this criterion, the\nrecord must not only establish the beneficiary’s contributions as original or novel, but the record must\nalso show the beneficiary’s contributions to the industry have had a major impact to the field. \nAlthough the authors of the letters claim the beneficiary has made contributions in the field of\nendeavor, the documentation to show that the beneficiary's work is being implemented by others in the\nfield, does not demonstrate that the beneficiary’s work has provoked widespread public commentary,\nand/or that the beneficiary has patents and/or licensed technology being used by others.  Simply\nhaving others cite the beneficiary’s work is insufficient to satisfy this criterion.  Please note, that while\nhaving others in the field cite the beneficiary’s work is noteworthy, it does not establish that work is of\nmajor significance in the field.\nFurthermore, the authors did not provide a title or list any information regarding their authority,\nexpertise, and knowledge of the beneficiary’s achievements.  While this provides information\nregarding the beneficiary's prior work, the letter does not contain sufficient detail regarding the\nauthors' credentials, the significance of their achievements, or the distinguished reputation of the\norganizations they represent that would establish they are a recognized expert in the field.\nYou may still submit evidence to satisfy this criterion.\nEvidence may include, but is not limited to:\nCopies of patents (showing the beneficiary as author or coauthor);\nObjective documentary evidence of the significance of the beneficiary's contribution to the field;\nDocumentary evidence indicating that people in the field of endeavor consider the beneficiary's\nwork important;\nTestimony or support letters from experts that discuss the beneficiary's contributions of major\nVSCI129VSCPPI00003644078516 of 21www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

They should explain, in detail, how the contribution was\n\"original\" (not merely replicating the work of others) and how they were of \"major\"\nsignificance.  General statements regarding the importance of the endeavors may be insufficient.\nScholarly Articles \nYou may submit evidence of the beneficiary's authorship of scholarly articles in the field, in\nprofessional journals or other major media (including electronic media).\nYou did not submit any evidence for this option.

That those organizations\nor establishments have a distinguished reputation.\nYour support letter states the following regarding the beneficiary’s eligibility under this criterion:\nEmployment in a Critical Role for Distinguished Organizations - Mr. Cooke has been engaged\nby Keith Kunz Motorsports (KKM) of Columbus, Indiana—one of America’s most respected\nracing teams—where he serves as Crew Chief and Setup Specialist. His engineering insight and\ntrack-side decision-making are critical to KKM’s competitive success in USAC and POWRi\nnational events (Exhibit 7).\nIt appears you are seeking to submit evidence relating to the beneficiary’s future employment with the\npetitioner as supporting evidence under this criterion.  Please note, 8 CFR 214.2(o)(3)(iii)(B)(7) states\nthe following relating to evidentiary requirements for establishing the beneficiary’s eligibility under\nthis criterion:\nEvidence that the alien has been employed in a critical or essential capacity for organizations\nand establishments that have a distinguished reputation.\nUSCIS recognizes your submission and statements indicating that you wish to have the beneficiary’s\nfuture employment with the petitioner to be considered as evidence under this criterion.  However, as\nstated above, to establish eligibility under this criterion, you must submit evidence showing the\nbeneficiary “has been” employed in a critical or essential capacity for organizations and\nestablishments that have distinguished reputations.  Evidence relating to future employment does not\nmeet the plain language of this criterion. \nYou may still submit evidence to satisfy this criterion. \nEvidence may include, but is not limited to, documentation that establishes the beneficiary's\nemployment in a critical capacity with an organization or establishment that has a distinguished\nreputation.\nRemuneration \nYou may submit evidence showing the beneficiary has commanded, now commands, or will command\na high salary or other substantial compensation.\nYou did not submit any evidence for this option.  You may still submit evidence to satisfy it.\nThe evidence to establish whether the beneficiary's compensation is high relative to others working in\nthe field may take many forms.  Examples may include but are not limited to:\nCopies of contracts or similar reliable evidence;\nDocuments showing the beneficiary received a high salary, or other significant forms of\ncompensation, for services in comparison to others in the field, which may include equity in\nlieu of cash;\nA statistical comparison of the salaries in the beneficiary's field from a government or private\ninstitution or a similar organization.  This should show that the beneficiary commanded a high\nsalary, or other significantly high remuneration, for services compared to others in the field;\nVSCI129VSCPPI00003644078518 of 21www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

If you submit DOL prevailing wage rate information, you should submit additional\nevidence showing that the wage rate is high relative to others working in the field (such as the\nexamples above).\nComparable Evidence\nIf the preceding achievement criteria did not readily apply to the beneficiary's occupation, you may\nsubmit comparable evidence to establish the beneficiary's eligibility.  You should indicate why the\ncriteria do not apply to the occupation. \nYou submitted comparable evidence. \nSpecifically, your support letter states the following:\nComparable Evidence - Sustained National Acclaim and Peer Recognition\n-Multiple letters of support from race officials and team leaders confirm that Mr. Cooke is\namong the top technical talents in his discipline (Exhibits 7-7).\n-Listing in international driver databases and team rosters further validates his global standing\n(Exhibit 13).\nHowever, you did not indicate which of the above criteria do not readily apply to the beneficiary's\noccupation, you did not explain how and/or why the criteria are not applicable to the beneficiary's\noccupation and you did not explain why the evidence you submitted is \"comparable\" to specific\ncriteria.\nWhen submitting comparable evidence, you should:\nExplain how the regulatory criteria are not applicable to the beneficiary's occupation; and\nExplain why the evidence you submitted is \"comparable\" to the applicable regulatory\nrequirement.\nPLACE THE ATTACHED COVERSHEET AND THIS ENTIRE LETTER ON TOP OF YOUR\nRESPONSE.

To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nOn October 20, 2025, you, INNOVATIVE GLOBAL TALENT AGENCY LLC (petitioner), filed a\npetition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), seeking O-1A nonimmigrant\nclassification for MARLEN AUGUSTA LORBERG LIJERON (beneficiary) to work as World Class.\nThe O-1A classification applies to individuals with extraordinary ability in the sciences, education,\nbusiness, or athletics.  The individual must have sustained national or international acclaim.  The\nindividual's achievements must be in the field of expertise and show that the individual is one of the\nsmall percentage who have risen to the very top of the field.  The individual must plan to continue to\nwork in the area of extraordinary ability.\nTo process your petition and determine if the beneficiary is eligible, additional information is\nrequired.  This request provides suggested evidence that you may submit to satisfy each requested\nitem.  You may:\nSubmit one, some, or all of these items. \nSubmit none of the suggested items and instead submit other evidence to satisfy the request. \nExplain how the evidence in the record already establishes eligibility.\nRequest a decision based on the record. \nNote, however, that you are responsible for providing evidence that best shows all requirements. \nEvidence must show eligibility for the requested benefit when you filed the petition.\nEvidence of Sustained National or International Acclaim\nYou must show that the beneficiary has sustained national or international acclaim and recognition for\nachievements in the field of expertise.  To demonstrate this, you may submit documentation to show\nthe beneficiary received a major, internationally recognized award, such as the Nobel Prize. \nAlternatively, you may show that the beneficiary satisfies at least three of the eight criteria discussed\nbelow.  Ultimately, the totality of the evidence must establish that the beneficiary has sustained\nnational or international acclaim and that the beneficiary’s level of expertise indicates that the\nbeneficiary is one of that small percentage who has risen to the very top of the field.\nEvidence of a Major, Internationally Recognized Award\nYou did not submit evidence for this option.  You may still submit evidence to satisfy it. \nEvidence that could help to determine that the award is major and internationally recognized may\nshow:\nThe award is internationally recognized as one of the top awards for the field;\nThe criteria used to grant the award;\nThe significance of the award in the field;\nThe reputation of the organization or the panel granting the award; \nPrevious winners of the award who held international acclaim at the time of receiving\nthe award; or\nHow the award attracts competition from internationally recognized individuals in the\nfield.\nAlternatively, you may attempt to qualify the beneficiary by providing evidence to satisfy at least\nthree of the criteria below.\nQualifying Criteria.  If you choose not to submit evidence of a one-time award, you may submit\nCSCI129CSCI120000363574962 of 9www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\ndocumentation of at least three of the criteria in this section.\nThe beneficiary does not appear to satisfy at least three of the eight criteria. You may still submit\nevidence to satisfy criteria in this section. \nAwards: You may submit evidence showing the beneficiary received nationally or internationally\nrecognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field.  These are awards that do not meet the level of\na major, internationally recognized award that would satisfy that alternate requirement.\nThe beneficiary appears to have met this criterion.\nMemberships in Associations: You may submit evidence showing the beneficiary belongs to\nassociations requiring outstanding achievements.  The achievements must be judged by recognized\nnational or international experts in relevant disciplines or fields.\nIn order to demonstrate that membership in an association meets this criterion, a petitioner must show\nthat the association requires outstanding achievements as an essential condition for admission to\nmembership. \nThe evidence you submitted is insufficient.  You submitted the following to indicate that the\nbeneficiary meets this criterion:\nBolivian National Team member\nDepartmental Gymnastics Association of Santa Cruz\nAn Invitation to train under Brazilian National Coach Anita Klemann\nUSCIS has reviewed all of the material and is unable to determine that the membership in these groups\nrequire outstanding achievements as an essential condition for membership.  \nIn regards to being on the Bolivian National Team, the record establishes that the beneficiary is a\nmember of the Bolivian National Team; however, the record does not establish that the members on\nthis team are members of any particular association.  Because the record does not address any\nparticular association, it does not establish that the beneficiary is a member of an association in the\nfield for which classification is sought.  Furthermore, you did not submit the requirements or criteria\nused for membership of the Bolivian National Team.  Therefore, the record does not satisfy the\ncriterion. \nYou also submitted a letter written by Silvia Yaneth Vasquez Pinedo (President of the Departmental\nGymnastics Association of Santa Cruz).  In part she writes: \"The Departmental Gymnastics\nAssociation of Santa Cruz certifies that Ms. Marlen Augusta Lorberg Lijeron is currently affiliated\nwith the Famiana Abastoflor Numberg FAN Rhythmic Gymnastics Training Center, which is part of\nour association and is located in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia.\"  While Ms. Vasquez Pinedo attests\nthat the beneficiary is affiliated with the training center, there is no indication in the record that being\naffiliated with the training center constitutes membership in the association.   Furthermore, you did not\nsubmit the requirements or criteria used for joining the Rhythmic Gymnastics Training Center.  \nIn regards to the invitation to train under Brazilian National Coach Anita Klemann, her letter states in\npart: \"Ms. Lorberg was invited to join our training program based on her athletic merits.  Throughout\nher time with us, she participated in high-performance training sessions alongside Brazilian national\nteam athletes.\"  As stated above in the first point, because the record does not address any particular\nassociation, it does not establish that the beneficiary is a member of an association in the field for\nwhich classification is sought.

Furthermore, you did not submit the requirements or criteria used to\ntrain with Anita Klemann other than her \"athletic merits\".   \nFor the reasons discussed above, the evidence submitted here does not show that the beneficiary has a\nmembership in as association that satisfies all elements of the criterion. \nYou may still submit evidence to satisfy this criterion.\nEvidence may include, but is not limited to, documentation showing:\nThe minimum requirements and criteria used to accept a person for the level\nof membership afforded to the beneficiary; \nEvidence of recognized national or international experts who make\ndeterminations about membership; and\nOther relevant requirements for the level of membership afforded to the\nbeneficiary.\nPublished Material: You may submit evidence of published material about the beneficiary, relating\nto his or her work in the field, in professional or major trade publications, or other forms of major\nmedia (including electronic media).  This must include the title, date, and author of the published\nmaterial, and any necessary translations.\nThe beneficiary appears to have met this criterion.\nJudging the Work of Others: You may submit evidence showing the beneficiary has participated as\na judge or on a panel that evaluated the work of others.  The work must have been in the beneficiary’s\nfield of specialization or in an allied field.\nYou did not submit evidence for this criterion.  You may still submit evidence to satisfy it\nEvidence may include, but is not limited to, evidence that the beneficiary has been a:\nReviewer of abstracts or papers submitted for presentation at scholarly\nconferences in the respective field;\nPeer reviewer for scholarly publications;\nMember of doctoral dissertation committees; or\nPeer reviewer for government research funding programs.\nOriginal Contributions: You may submit evidence showing the beneficiary made original\ncontributions in the sciences, academia, or a business-related endeavor of major significance in the\nfield.\nThe evidence you submitted is insufficient.  In support of this criterion you submitted the following:\nHer 2007 Gold medal redefined Bolivia's international status, inspiring national funding and\nyouth participation increases.\nMentorship and Talent Development Letter written by Fabiana Abastoflor\nSports media advocacy Letter written by Roberto Acosta Echavarria\nEducational impact \nRegarding the testimonial letters written by Fabiana Abastoflor and Roberto Acosta: \nFabiana Abastoflor states in part in her letter: \"Marlen and I have know each other for over 15 years. \nCSCI129CSCI120000363574964 of 9www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nFabiana Abastoflor states in part in her letter: \"Marlen and I have know each other for over 15 years. \nDuring that time, I've watched her evolve from a trailblazing gymnast to a passionate mentor.\"  Ms.\nAbastoflor goes on to say \"That experience showed me just how important it is to have role models\nlike Marlen, who supported me from the beginning and now stands by my side as we work to lift\nBolivian gymnastics to new heights.\"\nRoberto Acosta Echavarria states in part in his letter: \"However, her contributions go far beyond\ncompetition.  She launched independent media projects aimed at telling the stories of Bolivian\nathletes, particularly those working in less visible disciplines...In Summary, Marlen Lorberg has made\noriginal and lasting contributions to rhythmic gymnastics and continues to serve roles that strengthen\nthe sport's reach and impact.\"\nThese testimonials refer to the beneficiary's role of mentor and her multimedia projects.  They do not,\nhowever, establish that her contributions are already recognized as being majorly significant in the\noverall field of coaching or rhythmic gymnastics.  The authors ascertains in the above-referenced\nletters do not explain, for example, how the beneficiary's mentorship or independent media projects\nhave been widely implemented or relied upon by others in the field, and do not sufficiently identify\ntheir significance and influence.  General statements indicating that the beneficiary's\ncontributions are original and lasting are not sufficient without an explanation as to why the\ncontributions is deemed by experts as a contribution of major significance.  \nYou may still submit evidence to satisfy this criterion.\nEvidence may include, but is not limited to:\nPublished materials about the significance of the beneficiary’s original work; \nTestimonials, letters, and affidavits about the beneficiary’s original work;\nDocumentation that the beneficiary’s original work was cited at a level indicative of\nmajor significance in the field; and\nPatents or licenses deriving from the beneficiary’s work or evidence of commercial\nuse of the beneficiary’s work.\nNote:  If you submit letters and testimonies, they should provide as much detail as\npossible about the beneficiary’s contribution.  They should explain, in detail, how the\ncontribution was “original” (not merely replicating the work of others) and how it\nwas of “major” significance.  General statements regarding the importance of the\nendeavors may be insufficient.\nScholarly Articles: You may submit evidence of the beneficiary’s authorship of scholarly articles in\nthe field, in professional journals, or other major media.\nYou did not submit evidence for this criterion.  You may still submit evidence to satisfy it. \nEvidence may include, but is not limited to, copies of:\nPublications in professionally-relevant journals; \nPublished conference presentations at nationally or internationally recognized\nconferences;\nProfessional or major print publications (newspaper articles, popular and\nacademic journal articles, books, textbooks, or similar publications);\nProfessional or major online publications; \nEvidence of the publication’s intended audience; and\nCSCI129CSCI120000363574965 of 9www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nEvidence of the publication’s intended audience; and\nData regarding circulation, readership, or viewership.  \nNote: Circulation information should be specific to the media format in which it was\npublished.  For example, if the article was published online, the evidence must relate to\nthe website.  If it was published in print, the evidence must relate to the printed\npublication.\nEmployment in a Critical or Essential Capacity: You may submit evidence showing the beneficiary\nhas been employed in a critical or essential capacity for organizations and establishments that have a\ndistinguished reputation.\nThe evidence you submitted is insufficient.  In support of your petition, you submitted letters from\nindividuals who have worked with the beneficiary or are otherwise familiar with her career.  The\nletters you submitted are insufficient to satisfy this criterion.  While the letters are complimentary and\nprovide insight on the beneficiary's accomplishments, they do not specifically address how or why the\nbeneficiary was employed in a critical or essential capacity for the organizations as required by the\nregulations.  For example, in your letter you state the the Departmental Gymnastics Association of\nSanta Cruz confirms that the beneficiary holds a critical coaching position at the FAN Rhythmic\nGymnastics Training Center.  However, in the testimonial letter written by Silvia Yaneth Vasquez\nPinedo, President of the Departmental Gymnastics Association of Santa Cruz she merely states that the\nbeneficiary is affiliated with the Fabiana Abastoflor Numberg FAN Rhythmic Gymnastics Training\nCenter making no mention of the beneficiary being a coach or her critical role there.  There appears to\nbe nothing in the record that demonstrates specifically how the beneficiary was critical or essential. \nSimply stating that the beneficiary played an important role is not enough to satisfy your evidentiary\nburden.\nYou may still submit evidence to satisfy this criterion.\nEvidence may include, but is not limited to: \nEvidence that the beneficiary has been a: \nSenior faculty or senior research position for a distinguished academic\ndepartment or program;\nSenior research position for a distinguished non-academic institution\nor company;\nPrincipal or named investigator for a department, institution, or\nbusiness that received a merit-based government award, such as an\nacademic research or Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant;\nMember of a key committee within a distinguished organization; or\nFounder or co-founder of, or contributor of intellectual property to, a\nstartup business that has a distinguished reputation;\nEvidence that the beneficiary has had a critical or essential supporting role for a\ndistinguished organization or a distinguished division of an institution or company, as\nexplained in detail by the director or a principal investigator of the relevant\norganization or division;\nEvidence that the organization or establishment has a distinguished reputation such\nas: \nThe scale of its customer base, longevity, or relevant media coverage;\nNational rankings and receipt of government research grants;\nReceipt of significant funding from government entities, venture\ncapital funds, angel investors, or other such founders commensurate\nCSCI129CSCI120000363574966 of 9www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

You may still submit evidence to satisfy it. \nThe evidence to establish whether the beneficiary has commanded or will command a high salary or\nother substantial compensation, relative to others working in similar occupations in the field, may\ninclude but is not limited to:\nTax returns, pay statements, or other evidence of past salary or remuneration for\nservices;\nContract, job offer letter, or other evidence of prospective salary or remuneration for\nservices;\nComparative wage or remuneration data for the beneficiary’s field, such as\ngeographical or position-appropriate compensation surveys.\nOther Insufficiencies:\nItinerary:\nThe itinerary you submitted is vague with insufficient details on dates, names of the\nemployers, and location of the event(s).  The documentation you submitted is insufficient to\nestablish eligibility.  USCIS conducted a public records search and could not verify the most\nrecent upcoming events listed on your itinerary.  Your itinerary shows that the beneficiary\nwill perform services at:\nRhythmic Gymnastics Academy of Florida, in October of 2025, Miami FL.  Public\nrecords search for Rhythmic Gymnastics Academy of Florida found no results for this\nbusiness\nIGTA Sports Development Program, December 2025 Charlotte NC.  Public records\nsearch for IGTA found no upcoming events or calendar listing the development\nprogram\nCalifornia Elite Training Center February 2026, Los Angeles CA.  Public record\nsearch for California Elite Training Center found no results for this business.\nThe foregoing casts doubt on the credibility, reliability, and accuracy of the beneficiary's\ndefinite employment in the United States. \nPlease provide evidence to resolve the issue set forth. \nI-129:\nThe issue to be discussed is whether the I-129 is properly signed in accordance with\nregulations, the I-129 instructions, and USCIS policy.\nTitle 8, Code of Federal Regulations (8CFR) 103.2(a)(2) prescribes the requirements for\nsignatures on filing, in pertinent part:\nCSCI129CSCI120000363574967 of 9www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, and acceptable signature on a benefit\nrequest that is being filed with the USCIS si one that is either handwritten or, for benefit\nrequests filed electronically as permitted by the instructions to the form, in electronic format. \nThe regulations require that the signature on an application,petition, or request submitted on\npaper be handwritten and executed by an authorized signer with the power to bind the\npetitioner.  Therefore, a valid signature consists of any handwritten mark or sign made by an\nindividual, but it does not include signatures created by a typewriter, word processor, stamp,\nauto-pen, or similar device.  \nThe present form was not filed electronically, Therefore, the signatures on the present form\nmust be handwritten signatures.  \nThe Form I-129 instructions (Rev. 01/20/2025) further state the following regarding\nsignatures on a Form I-129:\nSignature. You (or your signing authority) must properly complete your petition. USCIS\nwill not accept a stamped or typewritten name in place of any signature on this petition. If\nyou are under 14 years of age, your parent or legal guardian may sign the petition on your\nbehalf. A legal guardian may also sign for a mentally incompetent person. If your petition\nis not signed, or if the signature is not valid, we will reject your petition. See 8 CFR\n103.2(a)(7)(ii)(A). If USCIS accepts a request for adjudication and determines that it has a\ndeficient signature, USCIS may deny the request.\nValidity of Signatures. USCIS will consider a photocopied, faxed, or scanned copy of an\noriginal handwritten signature as valid for filing purposes.

THIS\nPAGE MUST BE SUBMITTED WITH THE REQUESTED EVIDENCE. \nYou are receiving this notice because U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) requires\nadditional evidence to process your form.  Please provide the evidence requested on the attached\npage(s).  Include duplicate copies if you are requesting consular notification. \nYour response must be received by the address provided on the below coversheet by October 10,\n2025.\nPlease note that you have been allotted the maximum period allowed for responding to a Request for\nEvidence (RFE).  The time period for responding cannot be extended.  See Title 8 Code of Federal\nRegulations (8 CFR), Section 103.2(b)(8)(iv).  Because many immigration benefits are time sensitive,\nyou are encouraged to respond to this request as early as possible, but no later than the deadline\nprovided above.  If you do not respond to this notice within the allotted time, your case may be\ndenied. The regulations do not provide for an extension of time to submit the requested evidence.\nYou must submit all requested evidence at the same time.

You are seeking to employ or\nsponsor the beneficiary as a World Class Trick Rider. \nThe P-1A classification may be granted to internationally recognized athletes based on their\nreputations and achievements as individuals.  It may also be granted to groups of two or more\nindividuals that function as a unit and are internationally recognized as teams.  Beneficiaries must be\ncoming to the United States to perform services requiring an internationally recognized athlete or team\nat a specific athletic competition, as an athlete or team.\nTo process your petition and determine if the beneficiary is eligible, additional information is\nrequired.  This request provides suggested evidence that you may submit to satisfy each requested\nitem.  You may: \nsubmit one, some, or all of these items;\nsubmit none of the suggested items and instead submit other evidence to satisfy the request;\nexplain how the evidence in the record already establishes eligibility; and/or\nrequest a decision based on the record. \nPrior Approvals\nUSCIS acknowledges that the beneficiary has previously been granted the benefit being sought, that\nyou are requesting to extend your petition, and have requested USCIS grant deference to prior\napprovals when evaluating the beneficiary's eligibility for the benefit being sought.  When\nadjudicating a subsequent petition or application involving the same parties and the same underlying\nfacts, where appropriate, USCIS will generally defer to its prior determination of eligibility for the\nparticular nonimmigrant classification sought.\nHowever, each petition filing is a separate proceeding with a separate record.  Despite any previously\napproved petitions, the petitioner bears the burden to establish eligibility for each petition that it\nsubmits, and an immigration benefit cannot be granted when the petitioner fails to meet its burden of\nproof for the petition it files, including an extension petition. See INA § 291.  USCIS is not required to\napprove petitions where eligibility has not been demonstrated, merely because of prior approvals\nwhich may have been erroneous.  Matter of Church Scientology International, 19 I&N Dec. 593, 597\n(Comm'r 1988).\nUSCIS will not defer to prior approvals where:\nThere was a material error with regard to the previous approval(s);  1.\nThere has been a material change in circumstances or eligibility requirements; or  2.\nThere is new material information that adversely impacts the petitioner’s, beneficiary’s, or\napplicant’s eligibility.\n3.\nUSCIS recognizes your petition includes statements and supporting evidence referencing the\nbeneficiary’s prior approvals for the requested classification.  USCIS has reviewed this instant petition\nfiled on behalf of the beneficiary.  There has been a material change in circumstances or eligibility\nrequirements.  On Form I-129 Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, your requested filing\nclassification indicates there is a \"Change of Employer\".  Therefore, there has been a material change\nin circumstances or eligibility requirements. \nVSCI129VSCPPI0000349203012 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nAdditionally, you have not established the requirements for agent petitioners as described under 8\nCFR 214.2(p)(2)(iv)(E).  As such, there is new material information that adversely impacts the\npetitioner’s, beneficiaries’, or applicant’s eligibility.  \nFurthermore, if the same or similar evidence was submitted with the beneficiaries’ prior approvals,\nthere was a material error with regard to the previous approval(s).\nAs stated above, despite any previously approved petitions, the petitioner bears the burden to establish\neligibility for each petition that it submits, and an immigration benefit cannot be granted when the\npetitioner fails to meet its burden of proof for the petition it files, including an extension petition.\nTherefore, this petition must be supported by its own documentation and will be adjudicated based\nupon its own merits.  A more detailed discussion about the deficiencies will be discussed below.\nUSCIS will not defer to its prior approval in adjudicating this petition.\nTherefore, USCIS will not defer to its prior approval in adjudicating this petition.\nGeneral Requirements for All P Nonimmigrant Petitions\nIn general, petitions seeking P nonimmigrant classification must include the following:\nCopies of contracts;\nA description of the competition(s), event(s) or performance(s); and\nA consultation.\nTo satisfy these requirements, you submitted:\nA \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\";\nA copy of an itinerary; and\nTestimonial letters. \nContracts\nAll petitions seeking P nonimmigrant classification must be supported by a copy of a written contract,\nor if a written contract does not exist, a summary of the terms of the oral agreement between you and\nthe beneficiary, or team, named in the petition.\nUSCIS recognizes your submission of a \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" between you and the\nbeneficiary. However, the initial record includes conflicting information relating to the relationship\nbetween you, the beneficiary, and the employers who seek to hire the beneficiary for services rendered.\nFor example, in your petition support letter you state:\nThis letter is in connection with a P-1 A visa petition in which the Petitioner is acting as:\nAn employer with a bona fide job offer, where the Beneficiary will continue working directly in\nher area of extraordinary ability. No third-party authorizations are required for this direct\nemployment.\nThe Petitioner agrees to do the following:\n1. Represent the Beneficiary in activities and events related to trick riding performances\nand competitions within the United States.\nVSCI129VSCPPI0000349203013 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\n2. Accept service of process on behalf of the Beneficiary.\n3. Arrange reasonable travel accommodations for the Beneficiary if the visa status is\nterminated prematurely.\nThe Petitioner affirms that all information provided in this petition is true and accurate to the\nbest of its knowledge and belief. All involved parties have provided authorization for the\nsubmission of this visa petition.\nAs such, in your petition support letter you claim to be filing this petition as a U.S. agent performing\nthe function of the employer with \"no third-party authorizations\" required for the \"direct\nemployment\". \nHowever, in the \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" you claim to be filing the instant petition as a\n\"U.S. Agent for Multiple Employers\".  This agreement further states:\n2. ENGAGEMENT STRUCTURE\nDuring the term of this Agreement, the Beneficiary shall:\nPerform as a specialty act and trick rider at professional rodeos and equestrian events\nlisted in the attached itinerary;\nDeliver contracted performances in accordance with agreements coordinated by IGTA\nwith multiple U.S. rodeo organizations;\nContinued engagements consistent with her extraordinary ability as a PRCA and CPRA\ncarded trick rider.\n3. PETITIONER’S ROLE\nThe Petitioner agrees to:\nAct as USCIS-recognized agent for all U.S.-based engagements;\nMaintain signed or summarized documentation of all performance agreements and oral\ncommitments;\nAccept service of process on behalf of the Beneficiary during the validity period;\nAssist in coordinating lawful appearances in line with the Beneficiary’s skill and\nrecognition in the sport.\nRegarding the beneficiary's compensation the \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" states:\nCompensation for each engagement shall be defined by separate agreements with individual\nrodeo promoters and event coordinators. For example, the Beneficiary is scheduled to perform\nat events such as Rodeo Scottsdale, Big Sky Community Rodeo, and Queen Creek Fall Rodeo\nwith compensation of no less than $2500 USD per performance. IGTA maintains records of\nthese engagements in the supporting exhibits.\nRegardless of the capacity in which you are filing the instant petition, the evidence provided does not\nsatisfy the contract requirement. The \"Petition and Talent Agreement\" between you and the benefciary\nis insufficient to satisfy the contract requirement because this document is overly vague regarding\nterms of employment.  For example, the \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" states:\nVSCI129VSCPPI0000349203014 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nCompensation for each engagement shall be defined by separate agreements with individual\nrodeo promoters and event coordinators. For example, the Beneficiary is scheduled to perform\nat events such as Rodeo Scottsdale, Big Sky Community Rodeo, and Queen Creek Fall Rodeo\nwith compensation of no less than $2500 USD per performance. IGTA maintains records of\nthese engagements in the supporting exhibits.\nWhile the agreement indicates the beneficiary will earn \"no less than $2500 USD per performance\",\nthe \"Petition and Talent Agreement\" does not identify the entity responsible for compensating\nthe beneficiary for services rendered.  Moreover, the \"Petition and Talent Agreement\" does not\nadequately detail the terms and conditions of the beneficiary's employment at the rodeo events. \nPlease provide a statement clarifying your relationship with the beneficiary and provide the names of\nthe entities that will be employing the beneficiary. \nPlease provide a contract(s) or summary(ies) of the terms of an oral agreement to satisfy the\nrequirements specified below. \nIf the information you provide does not support approval of the full validity period requested, the\nperiod granted will be based on the evidence provided, which may be a limited validity period.\nWritten contracts or the summary of the terms of an oral agreement must specify the terms and\nconditions of employment, including:\nServices to be performed,\nWages,\nHours of work,\nWorking conditions, and\nAny fringe benefits.\nAdditionally, evidence must be submitted which establishes that the beneficiary has agreed to the offer.\nAgents and Sponsoring Organizations\nPetitions for P-1 nonimmigrants may be filed by: \nU.S. employers;\nU.S. agents;\nForeign employers through a U.S. agent; or\nU.S. sponsoring organizations. \nU.S. Agents\nIt appears that you are a U.S. agent filing this petition.  You must provide evidence to establish the\nrelationship between you and the relevant parties, showing that you are: \nPerforming the function of an employer;\nRepresenting the beneficiary and multiple employers with whom the beneficiary is contracted\nto work;\nRepresenting both the beneficiary and the employer; or\nRepresenting a foreign employer.\nTitle 8 CFR 214.2(p)(2)(iv)(E) states the following relating to Agents filing as petitioners:\nVSCI129VSCPPI0000349203015 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\n(E) Agents as petitioners. A United States agent may file a petition in cases involving workers\nwho are traditionally self-employed or workers who use agents to arrange short-term\nemployment on their behalf with numerous employers, and in cases where a foreign employer\nauthorizes the agent to act on its behalf. A United States agent may be: the actual employer of\nthe beneficiary; the representative of both the employer and the beneficiary; or, a person or\nentity authorized by the employer to act for, or in place of, the employer as its agent. A petition\nfiled by an United States agent is subject to the following conditions:\n(1) An agent performing the function of an employer must specify the wage offered and\nthe other terms and conditions of employment by contractual agreement with the\nbeneficiary or beneficiaries. The agent/employer must also provide an itinerary of\ndefinite employment and information on any other services planned for the period of\ntime requested.\n(2) A person or company in business as an agent may file the P petition involving\nmultiple employers as the representative of both the employers and the beneficiary or\nbeneficiaries if the supporting documentation includes a complete itinerary of services or\nengagements. The itinerary shall specify the dates of each service or engagement, the\nnames and addresses of the actual employers, the names and addresses of the\nestablishment, venues, or locations where the services will be performed. In questionable\ncases, a contract between the employer(s) and the beneficiary or beneficiaries may be\nrequired. The burden is on the agent to explain the terms and conditions of the\nemployment and to provide any required documentation.\n(3) A foreign employer who, through a United States agent, files a petition for a P\nnonimmigrant alien is responsible for complying with all of the employer sanctions\nprovisions of section 274A of the Act and 8 CFR part 274a.\n Agents Performing the Function of an Employer\nIt appears that you may be an agent performing the function of an employer in this filing. To satisfy the\nconditions of an agent performing the function of an employer you must submit:\nA written contract, or if a written contract does not exist, the summary of the terms of the oral\nagreement that: \nSpecifies the wage offered and other terms of employment; and\nDetails any additional services provided.\nAn itinerary of definite employment and information on any other services planned for the\nperiod of time requested. \nOne of the U.S. agent scenarios you have put forward is that you are filing this petition as a U.S. agent\nperforming the function of the employer with \"no third-party authorizations\" required for the \"direct\nemployment\".  However, the submitted \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" does not establish that the\nbeneficiary will receive remuneration from your agency as the beneficiary’s employer.  Further, the\ninitial record does not contain evidence of any contractual agreement or summary of terms for any\nfuture rodeo events establishing that, at the time of filing, your agency has negotiated and arranged\nany events on the beneficiary’s behalf.\nIn addition, the \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" does not provide sufficient details of the terms and\nconditions of the benefciary's employment. Rather, it appears to be an agreement that details the terms\nof your U.S. agent relationship with the beneficiary and her multiple employers. As such,\nthe \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" does not establish the terms and conditions of the beneficiary's\nVSCI129VSCPPI0000349203016 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

In support of your petition, you provided a\n\"2025-2028 U.S. Trick Riding Performance Itinerary\" that lists events occurring monthly during the\nremainder of 2025. Although the itinerary includes dates and states where the competitions will occur,\nit is incomplete and vague. The included itinerary does not include names and addresses of the\nlocations which the beneficiary will compete. Itineraries of events and/or engagements must include\nthe names and addresses of the entities with whom the beneficiary is contracted to perform the services\nand the names and addresses of the establishments, venues, or locations where the services will be\nperformed.\nFurther, the \"2025-2028 U.S. Trick Riding Performance Itinerary\" states:\nThis itinerary outlines Bella Da Costa's anticipated performance schedule as a professional\ntrick rider in the United States from 2025 to 2028...\nEvents listed for 2026 through 2028 will follow a similar pattern, with Bella Da Costa \nappearing annually in 8-10 high-profile trick riding events across various U.S. states.\nHowever, USCIS finds that the beneficiary's \"anticipated performance schedule\" does not demonstrate\ndefinite employment for the beneficiary as required by regulations. Furthermore, you did not\nprovide corroborative documentation that would establish that, at the time of filing, your agency had\nnegotiated entry into the events on the beneficiary’s behalf. \nGiven these deficiencies, the \"2025-2028 U.S. Trick Riding Performance Itinerary\" absent the support\nof corroborative documentation, does not establish an itinerary of definite employment for the\nbeneficiary. USCIS requests that you provide corroborative documentation that would establish that, at\nthe time of filing this petition, your agency has secured definite employment for the beneficiary during\nthe requested validity period. \nYou may still submit evidence to satisfy this requirement.\nAgents representing both the beneficiary and one or more employers must submit:\nThe employment described in the \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\",  appears to be indicative of a\nU.S. agent representing the beneficiary and his mulitple employers.\nEvidence that the agent is authorized to act as an agent on behalf of the beneficiary and all of\nthe entities with whom the beneficiary is contracted to perform the services;\nA complete itinerary of services or engagements that: \nSpecifies the dates of each service or engagement;\nProvides the names and addresses of the entities with whom the beneficiary is contracted\nto perform the services; and\nProvides the names and addresses of the establishments, venues or locations where the\nservices will actually be performed. \nIn the  \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\" you claim to be \"serving in the capacity of\" U.S. agent for\nmultiple employers.  The agreement further states:\nWHEREAS, the Beneficiary is internationally recognized as a premier equestrian athlete and\nVSCI129VSCPPI0000349203017 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

ENGAGEMENT STRUCTURE\nDuring the term of this Agreement, the Beneficiary shall:\nPerform as a specialty act and trick rider at professional rodeos and equestrian events\nlisted in the attached itinerary;\nDeliver contracted performances in accordance with agreements coordinated by IGTA\nwith multiple U.S. rodeo organizations;\nContinued engagements consistent with her extraordinary ability as a PRCA and CPRA\ncarded trick rider.\n3. PETITIONER’S ROLE\nThe Petitioner agrees to:\nAct as USCIS-recognized agent for all U.S.-based engagements;\nMaintain signed or summarized documentation of all performance agreements and oral\ncommitments;\nAccept service of process on behalf of the Beneficiary during the validity period;\nAssist in coordinating lawful appearances in line with the Beneficiary’s skill and\nrecognition in the sport.\nAs this type of agent, you are required to submit evidence that you have been authorized to act as an\nagent on behalf of the beneficiary and all of the entities with whom the beneficiary is contracted to\nperform services. While the record establishes you have been authorized to act as the beneficiary's\nagent, it has not been established you have been authorized to act as an agent on the behalf of the\nentities with the entities who seek to hire the beneficiary for services rendered.\nFurther, as stated above, an agent representing the beneficiary and one or more employers is required\nto submit a complete itinerary of services or engagements which specifies the dates of each service or\nengagement, the names and addresses of the actual employers, the names and addresses of the\nestablishment, venues, or locations where the services will be performed.  \nIn support of your petition, you provided a \"2025-2028 U.S. Trick Riding Performance Itinerary\" that\nlists events occurring monthly during the remainder of 2025. Although the itinerary includes dates and\nstates where the competitions will occur, it is incomplete and vague. The included itinerary does not\ninclude names and addresses of the locations which the beneficiary will compete. Itineraries of events\nand/or engagements must include the names and addresses of the entities with whom the beneficiary is\ncontracted to perform the services and the names and addresses of the establishments, venues, or\nlocations where the services will be performed.  Furthermore, the \"Petitioner and Talent Agreement\"\ndoes not indicate who the beneficiary's employers will be when engaging in those activities.  \nAs such, the description of the event you submitted is insufficient to meet the regulatory itinerary\nVSCI129VSCPPI0000349203018 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

As defined in statute and\nregulation, a beneficiary may qualify for the P-1A classification as an internationally recognized\nathlete, a professional athlete, an amateur athlete, or as a professional or amateur skater who performs\nindividually or as part of a group in a theatrical ice skating production.  \nAs you do not claim the beneficiary qualifies as a professional athlete, an amateur athlete, a\nprofessional or amateur skater who performs individually or as a part of a group in a theatrical ice\nskating production, these grounds of eligibility will not be discussed further in this request. \nInternationally Recognized Athlete or Team\nA beneficiary may qualify as a P-1A internationally recognized athlete if the beneficiary performs as\nan athlete, individually or as part of a group or team, at an internationally recognized level of\nperformance and seeks to enter the United States temporarily for the purpose of performing as such an\nathlete with respect to a specific athletic competition. Specifically, the P-1A must be coming to\nperform services which require an internationally recognized athlete or team. \nInternationally recognized means having a high level of achievement in a field evidenced by a degree\nof skill and recognition substantially above that ordinarily encountered, to the extent that such\nachievement is renowned, leading, or well-known in more than one country.\nSolely Competing\nIn order to be eligible for the P-1A classification, the beneficiary must be coming to the United States \nsolely for the purpose of performing in a specific athletic competition as an athlete or coach, as\napplicable.  Alternatively, athletes coming to the United States to perform in theatrical ice skating\nproductions must be coming solely to perform in specific ice skating productions or tours.  Permissible\nactivities also include short vacations, promotional appearances for the petitioning employer relating to\nthe competition, event or performance, and stopovers which are incidental and/or related to the\nactivity.\nVSCI129VSCPPI0000349203019 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account. To learn more about creating an account and the benefits, go to https://www.uscis.gov/file-online.\n\nThe evidence you submitted is insufficient to establish that the beneficiary will be performing\n(including permissible related/incidental activities) solely as an athlete with respect to a specific\nathletic competition.\nAs explained above, you did not submit evidence that establishes the specific competition in which the\nbeneficiary will perform. Rather, you provided a list of \"anticipated events\".  \nAs it relates to these \"anticipated events\", the \"Roles & Description\"  section of the itinerary indicates\nthat the beneficiary will perform for rodeos in roles such as \"Featured Trick Rider\", \"Specialty Act\", \n\"Headlining Act\", and \"Closing Act\".  The record does not establish that these roles are consistent with\nan athlete competing in an athletic competition.  \nIn addition, the submitted itinerary shows that the beneficiary will participate in clinics and expos in\nroles such as \"Guest Clinician - Filmed Instructional appearances\" at the PRCA Clinic and Filming\nand \"Demo Rider - Educational equestrian showcase\" at the Idaho Horse Expo.  The record does not\nestablish that clinics and expos are athletic competition.  For example, the submitted articles about the\nIdaho Horse Expo provides a brief explanation of the event:\nEach year the Idaho Horse Council produces the State’s largest equine EXPO which attracts\nexhibitors and spectators from across the United States. The EXPO features highly regarded\ntrainers and clinicians from across the state and nation, the latest in products ranging from\njewelry to arena equipment, entertainment, industry-related seminars, youth activities, and\ncompetitions from youth roping, to trail events and even jousting.\nIt does not appear the Idaho Horse Expo is a Trick Riding competition or that the beneficiary's\nparticipation in the Idaho Horse Expo will be a promotional appearance for her employer relating to\na competition. \nFinally, in her statement, the beneficiary describes herself as a \"Contract Act\" and explains that she\nperforms acts at rodeos, but does not indicate that she competes in them.  \nTherefore, you have not establish that the beneficiary is coming to the United States solely for the\npurpose of performing in a specific athletic competition as an athlete. \nYou may still submit evidence to satisfy it.\nInternationally Recognized Level of Competition\nThe evidence in the record must demonstrate that the beneficiary (as an individual athlete or as a\nmember of an athletic team) is coming to the United States to participate in an athletic competition or\nleague that has a distinguished reputation and which requires participation of an athlete or athletic team\nthat has an international reputation.  \nThe evidence you submitted is insufficient. \nYou submitted various articles about the rodeos in which the beneficiary will perform.  However,\nwhile these documents provide a general overview of the rodeos, they do not sufficiently establish\nhow and/or why the beneficiary's Trick Riding performance is an athletic competition or a league that\nhas a distinguished reputation and which requires participation of an athlete or athletic team that has an\ninternational reputation. \nFurther, as explained above, the itinerary indicates that the beneficiary will perform for rodeos in roles\nVSCI129VSCPPI00003492030110 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.

The initial\nrecord does not establish that Trick Riding is a competitive event at the rodeos.  In addition, the\nsubmitted itinerary shows that the beneficiary will participate in clinics and expos in roles such as\n\"Guest Clinician - Filmed Instructional appearances\" at the PRCA Clinic and Filming and \"Demo\nRider - Educational equestrian showcase\" at the Idaho Horse Expo. Therefore, the initial record does\nnot establish that the beneficiary's roles as explained in the itinerary are consistent with an athlete\ncompeting in an athletic competition or league requires participation of an athlete or athletic team that\nhas an international reputation. \nYou may still submit evidence to satisfy this requirement.\nPlease submit evidence that the beneficiary is coming to the United States to participate in an athletic\ncompetition or league requires participation of an athlete or athletic team that has an international\nreputation. \nPlease submit evidence that the beneficiary will be competing at an internationally recognized level, in\ncompetitions or leagues with a distinguished reputation and that require, among its participants, an\ninternationally recognized athlete.  This evidence may include, but is not limited to:\nPublished materials or documentation about the competition or league demonstrating the\nextent of media coverage;\nRequirements to qualify for participation in the competition or league;\nInternational ranking of athletes competing;\nStructure of the competition or league (including major, minor, regional/local, or academy\nteams);\nViewership and/or attendance data;\nRevenue data;\nPrize money or awards attached to the competitions.\nTendered Contract\nThe evidence in the record must include a tendered contract with a major United States sports league\nor team, or a tendered contract in an individual sport commensurate with international recognition in\nthat sport, if such contracts are normally executed in the sport.\nThe evidence you submitted is insufficient. \nOn March 26, 2021, USCIS issued policy guidance concerning P-1A internationally recognized\nathletes, and clarified:\nUSCIS interprets \"major United States sports league\" as a league that has a distinguished\nreputation that is commensurate with an internationally recognized level of performance, and\n\"major United States sports team\" as a team that participates in such a league, consistent\nwith the statutory standard for internationally recognized athletes.\"\nYou submitted no contracts with the organizing bodies or official invites to any of the events listed in\nthe itinerary.  Further, the record is absent supporting documentation about the events listed on the\nitinerary that would establish the events' status as internationally recognized events and are considered\nmajor United States sports leagues.\nFurther, as explained above, the itinerary indicates that the beneficiary will perform for rodeos in roles\nVSCI129VSCPPI00003492030111 of 13www.uscis.gov\nUSCIS encourages you to sign up for a USCIS online account.
