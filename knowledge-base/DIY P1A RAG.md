The Petitioner directly employs the Beneficiary under a traditional employer-employee relationship, maintaining full control over employment terms, including wages, duties, and schedules.

â˜ U.S. Agent Functioning as Employer The Petitioner serves as a U.S. Agent, assuming employer responsibilities for the Beneficiary.

The Petitioner acts as a U.S. Agent representing a self-employed foreign athlete. The Petitioner coordinates the Beneficiaryâ€™s competitive events and ensures compliance with immigration regulations. Authorization documentation from the Beneficiary is included.

Petitioner Obligations

The Petitioner agrees to the following obligations:

1. Representation: Represent the Beneficiary to participate in competitions and events related to their intended athletic activities in the United States.  
2. Service of Process: Accept service of process on behalf of the Beneficiary and, if applicable, for Foreign Employers or multiple employers included in the petition. Authorization from all relevant parties is included.  
3. Travel Support: Secure reasonable travel arrangements for the Beneficiary if the visa is terminated early.  
4. Certification of Accuracy: Certify that the contents of this petition are accurate and truthful to the best of the Petitionerâ€™s knowledge and affirm that all parties provided authorization and consent to file this petition.

Duration of Agreement The terms of this Agreement shall commence upon the date of approval of the Beneficiaryâ€™s visa application and shall remain effective for the duration of the approved visa period, specifically for \_ year(s). This period supersedes any conflicting dates listed on Form I-129 or supporting documents, aligning directly with the period of approval granted by USCIS.

**THE BENEFICIARY HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY APPROVED IN THE SAME VISA CATEGORY**

In accordance with Policy Memorandum PA-2021-05 (Deference to Prior Determinations of Eligibility in Requests for Extensions of Petition Validity), USCIS policy explicitly states that deference should be given to prior determinations of eligibility for the same visa category, provided the following conditions are met:

1. There has been no material change in the underlying facts or circumstances affecting the petitioner's, applicant's, or beneficiary's eligibility.  
2. There is no material error in the prior adjudication.  
3. There is no new adverse material information impacting eligibility.

USCIS defines material changes as significant alterations in the terms of employment, the nature of the beneficiaryâ€™s role, or the relationship between the petitioner and the beneficiary that directly impact the eligibility criteria for the visa classification. Routine updates, administrative adjustments, or changes in employment structure (e.g., transitioning to a U.S. agent for multiple employers) that do not affect the beneficiaryâ€™s international recognition or ability to perform at an internationally recognized level are not considered material changes under applicable law and policy.

The Beneficiary has been previously approved in the same visa category, and the following facts remain unchanged:

1. The Beneficiary continues to meet the eligibility requirements for international recognition, which have already been adjudicated and established.  
2. The job duties and intended activities remain consistent with the scope of the original petition.  
3. The petitioner and beneficiary relationship, including any structural changes such as transitioning to a U.S. agent representing multiple or foreign employers, does not alter the fundamental eligibility already determined by USCIS.

It is against USCIS policy to reopen or reevaluate a beneficiaryâ€™s established eligibility for international recognition when there have been no material changes undermining the validity of prior approvals. Matter of Church Scientology International, 19 I\&N Dec. 593, 597 (Comm'r 1988\) further establishes that each petition must be adjudicated based on the facts and eligibility requirements at the time of filing. Revisiting previously established eligibility without a justified material change violates procedural fairness and the principles outlined in PA-2021-05.

Therefore, this petition should be evaluated favorably, as the Beneficiaryâ€™s eligibility remains intact, and no material changes, errors, or adverse information exist that would warrant reevaluation. The referenced policy memorandum is included as an exhibit for review.
