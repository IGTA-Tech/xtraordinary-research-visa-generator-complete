Dear Immigration Examiner: 

This letter is in connection with an O-1A visa petition in which the Petitioner is acting as: 

**Petitioner Employment Structure**

The Petitioner is serving in the following role(s) as indicated by an â€œXâ€ below and supporting documentation is included with this submission.

â˜ **Direct Employer**  
    The Petitioner directly employs the Beneficiary under a traditional employer-employee relationship, maintaining full control over the terms of employment, including wages, duties, and schedule.

â˜ **U.S. Agent Functioning as Employer**  
    The Petitioner serves as a U.S. Agent, assuming employer responsibilities for the Beneficiary. This includes maintaining control over the terms of engagements and ensuring compliance with labor and immigration laws. The Petitioner oversees multiple engagements that may involve various end clients or organizations.

â˜ **U.S. Agent for Foreign Employer**  
    The Petitioner acts as a U.S. Agent on behalf of a foreign employer. The Petitioner is authorized to file this petition and accept service of process for the foreign employer. Authorization documentation is included in this petition.

â˜ **U.S. Agent for Multiple Employers**  
    The Petitioner acts as a U.S. Agent representing multiple employers. The Petitioner is responsible for coordinating engagements and ensuring compliance with U.S. labor and immigration regulations on behalf of all employers. Authorization from each employer is included in this petition.

â˜ **U.S. Agent for Foreign Employer who is Self-Employed**  
    The Petitioner acts as a U.S. Agent representing a self-employed foreign employer. This structure requires the Petitioner to coordinate the Beneficiaryâ€™s activities and ensure compliance with U.S. labor and immigration regulations. Authorization documentation from the foreign employer is included in this petition.

**Petitioner Obligations**

the Petitioner agrees to the following obligations:

1. **Representation**: Represent the Beneficiary to participate in events related to their intended activities in the United States. Examples include competitions and related events for an athlete, or business seminars and events for an entrepreneur or executive.  
2. **Service of Process**: Accept service of process on behalf of the Beneficiary, and if applicable, for Foreign Employers or multiple employers included in the petition. Authorization documentation from all relevant parties is included in this petition.  
3. **Travel Support**: Secure reasonable travel for the Beneficiary in the event the visa is terminated early.  
4. **Certification of Accuracy**: Certify that the contents of this petition are true to the best of the Petitionerâ€™s knowledge and belief. The Petitioner affirms that all parties have provided their authorization and consent for this petition to be filed.

**Duration of Agreement**

The terms of this Agreement shall commence upon the date of approval of the Beneficiaryâ€™s visa application and shall remain in effect for the duration of the approved visa period, specifically for **\_ year(s)**. This duration shall supersede any dates listed on the Form I-129 or supporting documents if those dates conflict with the period of approval granted by USCIS.

**THE BENEFICIARY HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY APPROVED IN THE SAME VISA CATEGORY**

In accordance with **Policy Memorandum PA-2021-05** (Deference to Prior Determinations of Eligibility in Requests for Extensions of Petition Validity), USCIS policy explicitly states that deference should be given to prior determinations of eligibility for the same visa category, provided the following conditions are met:

1. There has been **no material change** in the underlying facts or circumstances affecting the petitioner's, applicant's, or beneficiary's eligibility.  
2. There is **no material error** in the prior adjudication.  
3. There is **no new adverse material information** impacting eligibility.

USCIS defines **material changes** as significant alterations in the terms of employment, the nature of the beneficiaryâ€™s role, or the relationship between the petitioner and the beneficiary that directly impact the eligibility criteria for the visa classification. Routine updates, administrative adjustments, or changes in employment structure (e.g., transitioning to a U.S. agent for multiple employers) that do not affect the beneficiaryâ€™s **international recognition or extraordinary ability** are not considered material changes under applicable law and policy.

The Beneficiary has been previously approved in the same visa category, and the following facts remain unchanged:

1. The Beneficiary continues to meet the eligibility requirements for extraordinary ability or international recognition, which have already been adjudicated and established.  
2. The job duties and intended activities remain consistent with the scope of the original petition.  
3. The petitioner and beneficiary relationship, or any structural changes such as a U.S. agent representing multiple employers or foreign employers, do not alter the fundamental eligibility already determined by USCIS.

It is against USCIS policy to reopen or reevaluate a beneficiaryâ€™s established eligibility for extraordinary ability or international recognition when there have been no material changes that undermine the validity of prior approvals. **Matter of Church Scientology International, 19 I\&N Dec. 593, 597 (Comm'r 1988\)** further establishes that each petition must be adjudicated based on the facts and eligibility requirements at the time of filing. Revisiting previously established eligibility without a justified material change violates procedural fairness and the principles outlined in PA-2021-05.

Therefore, this petition should be evaluated favorably, as the Beneficiaryâ€™s eligibility remains intact, and no material changes, errors, or adverse information exist that would warrant reevaluation. The referenced policy memorandum is included as an exhibit for review.

**ABOUT THE PETITIONER:** 

In compliance with **8 CFR Â§ 214.2(o)(2)(ii)(A)** and **8 CFR Â§ 214.2(p)(2)(ii)(A)**, this petition provides all information required by the applicable regulations:

* The Petitioner is a U.S. entity authorized to file this petition under the regulations.  
* The Petitioner is serving in the capacity of \[Direct Employer/U.S. Agent\], as designated in this petition, with all required acknowledgments and permissions made in accordance with the regulations.  
* The Petitioner affirms its responsibility to comply with all requirements established by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in connection with this petition.

Additionally, this section may address the terms and conditions of employment, and any other statutory provisions relevant to maintaining compliance with U.S. immigration law. By providing a comprehensive overview of these regulatory requirements, and lining up the Beneficiaryâ€™s qualifications under each requirement, the Petitioner ensures clarity and adherence to the legal framework essential for the successful processing of the visa application.

**The supporting documentation for an O-1A petition must include evidence that the Beneficiary has a major internationally recognized award (such as the Nobel Prize) or at least three of the following forms of evidence:**

(i) Documentation of the Beneficiaryâ€™s receipt of nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor.

This section addresses whether the Beneficiary qualifies for the O-1A visa based on the receipt of a major, internationally recognized award, as defined under **8 CFR Â§ 214.2(o)(3)(iii)**.

â˜ **Yes**, the Beneficiary is pursuing qualification under the single major award category.  
â˜ **No**, the Beneficiary is not pursuing qualification under the single major award category.

6. **Proof of Receipt**: Official certification or confirmation of the Beneficiaryâ€™s receipt of the award, along with any supporting documentation such as award plaques, certificates, or formal announcements.

**Citation**: The above elements align with the requirements of **8 CFR Â§ 214.2(o)(3)(iii)**, which defines a major internationally recognized award as independently sufficient evidence of extraordinary ability.

**BENEFICIARY ELIGIBILITY UNDER LESSOR CATEGORIES:**
