### CRITERION 4: JUDGING THE WORK OF OTHERS

**Status: âœ“ MODERATE EVIDENCE**

#### Training Partner Role at Jackson Wink MMA

**Evidence of Judging Others' Work:**

While not a formal judge or referee, Fialho's role as an elite training partner at Jackson Wink MMA involves:

1. **Technical Feedback to Training Partners**
   - Daily sparring sessions with world champions
   - Providing resistance and testing techniques

   - Elite fighters rely on training partners' assessments
   - Fialho's striking expertise used to prepare teammates

**Comparable Evidence Argument:**

In martial arts, the traditional "judging" criterion (serving as competition judge, peer reviewer, etc.) doesn't readily apply to active competitors. However, the role of elite training partner at world's #1 camp involves:

- **Assessment of Techniques**: Providing feedback on effectiveness
- **Skill Evaluation**: Helping teammates gauge readiness

- **Technical Innovation**: Bringing multi-disciplinary expertise to training environment
- **Cultural Contributions**: Representing martial arts internationally

---

### CRITERION 6: SCHOLARLY ARTICLES

**Status: âœ— NOT APPLICABLE - COMPARABLE EVIDENCE**

**Explanation of Inapplicability:**
The scholarly articles criterion requires authorship of articles in professional journals or major media. This criterion does not readily apply to professional athletes whose contributions are through performance rather than written scholarship.

**Comparable Evidence:**

Instead of scholarly articles, we offer comparable evidence of Fialho's recognized expertise:

1. **Published Interviews and Profiles**
   - UFC.com Q&A interview
   - ESPN fighter questionnaire responses
   - Sherdog feature interviews
   - Media appearances discussing martial arts

2. **Video Content Demonstrating Expertise**
   - Training footage showing technical proficiency
   - Instructional content (if available)
   - Fight analysis featuring his techniques
   - Interview content discussing martial arts philosophy

3. **Performance Documentation**
   - Fight videos analyzed by experts
   - Technical breakdowns by media
   - Performance statistics in published databases
   - Video highlights demonstrating martial arts expertise

**Why This Is Comparable:**
- Professional athletes demonstrate expertise through performance, not publication
- Video documentation of elite-level performance serves same purpose as scholarly writing (demonstrating expertise)
- Media analysis of his performances serves similar function to scholarly peer review
- His fights broadcast to millions serve as "publication" of his expertise

**Supporting USCIS Guidance:**
USCIS policy memo (2024) acknowledges that certain occupations don't readily involve scholarly publication. For athletes, comparable evidence includes:
- Media coverage analyzing performance
- Video documentation of technical excellence
- Professional recognition through awards and selection
- Expert analysis of contributions to sport

- Singapore Indoor Stadium: 12,000-seat premier Asian venue
- UFC APEX: Purpose-built broadcast facility, featured on ESPN regularly

**Industry Recognition:**
- Featured on world's largest sports network (ESPN)
- Broadcast in 175+ countries
- Covered by major sports media outlets
- Participation in main cards and featured preliminary positions

---

#### Comparable Evidence Justification:

The "exhibitions or showcases" criterion is directly applicable to professional combat sports. MMA events function as:
- **Athletic Showcases**: Demonstrating martial arts expertise before large audiences
- **Competitive Exhibitions**: Testing skills against world-class opponents
- **Performance Art**: Combining technical skill, strategy, and physical performance
- **Global Presentations**: Broadcast internationally, similar to artistic performances

**Why MMA Events Qualify:**
1. **Selective Participation**: Only elite fighters selected to compete at this level
2. **Large Audiences**: Millions of viewers per event
3. **Expert Recognition**: Selection by premier organizations
4. **International Reach**: Global broadcast and attendance
5. **Documented Excellence**: Performance bonuses, media coverage, statistical analysis

Recent USCIS guidance explicitly recognizes that athletic competitions constitute "exhibitions" under this criterion, particularly when:
- Held in venues of distinction (major arenas)
- Broadcast to large audiences (television, streaming)
- Require high-level skill and recognition for participation
- Covered by major media outlets

---

#### Comparable Evidence Justification:

**High Salary in Martial Arts Context:**

The "high salary" criterion requires compensation "substantially above that ordinarily earned by others in the field." Evidence demonstrates:

1. **Above Median**: $200,000+ annual earnings significantly exceeds $40,000-60,000 median for professional MMA fighters

2. **Performance Recognition**: $150,000 in performance bonuses demonstrates exceptional performance compensation

**USCIS Interpretation:**
Recent guidance recognizes that "high salary" is relative to field. For professional athletes:
- Comparison should be to others in same sport/level
- Performance bonuses demonstrate exceptional compensation
- Selection by premier organizations indicates earning capacity
- Top percentile placement satisfies criterion

**Alternative Salary Evidence:**
If specific salary figures are unavailable, we can demonstrate:

## COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH OTHER EB-1A ATHLETES

### Favorable Comparisons:

**Compared to Approved EB-1A Athletes:**

1. **Lower-Profile Professional Athletes:**
   - Fialho's UFC participation exceeds requirements for athletes in lesser-known sports
   - Performance bonuses demonstrate recognition beyond mere participation
   - Training at world's #1 facility distinguishes from regional/national level athletes

2. **Combat Sports Athletes:**
   - Participation in UFC alone is stronger than many approved regional kickboxers, boxers
   - Multiple major organizations (UFC, Bellator, PFL) show breadth
   - Jackson Wink association is top-tier credential in martial arts

3. **Team Sport Athletes:**
   - Individual recognition (performance bonuses) stronger than bench players on major teams
   - Media coverage comparable to professional athletes in team sports
   - Training partner role equivalent to practice squad players who receive EB-1A approval

---

### Addressing Potential Weaknesses:

**1. Record Not Dominant (16-9):**
- **Counter**: Level of competition is highest in world (UFC, Bellator, PFL)
- **Counter**: Losses to ranked contenders and elite opponents (Jake Matthews, Muslim Salikhov, Joaquin Buckley)
- **Counter**: Performance bonuses show exceptional moments despite mixed record
- **Strategy**: Emphasize quality of competition over quantity of wins
- **Analogies**: Professional athletes in premier leagues with .500 records still receive EB-1A based on level of competition

**2. Released from UFC (October 2023):**
- **Counter**: Two-year UFC tenure still establishes elite status
- **Counter**: Jackson Wink membership continues post-UFC
- **Counter**: 7 UFC fights represent substantial sustained performance
- **Strategy**: Focus on achievements during UFC tenure, ongoing training contributions
- **Context**: Many EB-1A recipients no longer actively competing when petitioning

**3. Not a Champion:**
- **Counter**: EB-1A doesn't require championships, only "extraordinary ability"
- **Counter**: Performance bonuses are form of exceptional recognition
- **Counter**: Training at #1 facility demonstrates peer recognition of abilities
- **Strategy**: Emphasize "extraordinary" as top percentile, not necessarily #1 globally
- **Analogies**: Professional athletes without championships receive EB-1A based on sustained elite performance

**4. Not Currently Fighting:**
- **Counter**: Ongoing training contributions at Jackson Wink demonstrate continued engagement
- **Counter**: EB-1A focuses on past achievements showing extraordinary ability
- **Counter**: "Intends to continue work" can include training, coaching development
- **Strategy**: Present as martial arts professional, not just fighter
- **Future Plans**: Emphasize potential return to competition, training contributions, possible coaching development

---

- Competition at the highest international level
- Training contributions to world champions
- Technical mastery across multiple martial arts disciplines
- Recognition by sport's most prestigious organizations and media
- Financial compensation reflecting elite status

This positioning emphasizes the **holistic martial artist** rather than focusing narrowly on win-loss record, allowing us to leverage training contributions, media recognition, and organizational affiliations alongside competitive achievements.
