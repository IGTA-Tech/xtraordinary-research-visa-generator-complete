## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### A. Petitioner Overview

**Name:** [Full Legal Name]  
**Date of Birth:** [DOB]  
**Nationality:** [Country]  
**Current Status:** [Immigration status/location]  
**Years in Field:** [Number] years ([Start Year] - Present)  

**Field Definition:** [Clearly define the field - be specific but not overly narrow. Examples: "Professional Martial Arts," "Software Engineering," "Biotechnology Research," "Professional Athletics - Soccer"]

### B. Strategic Positioning Statement

[NAME] should be positioned as a [specific professional description] rather than simply a [generic job title]. This distinction is critical for EB-1A approval because it allows demonstration of extraordinary ability across multiple dimensions:

1. **[Primary Dimension]**: [Brief description of excellence]
2. **[Secondary Dimension]**: [Brief description of contributions]
3. **[Tertiary Dimension]**: [Brief description of industry impact]
4. **[Additional Dimension]**: [Brief description of sustained acclaim]

This multi-dimensional approach strengthens the petition by showing [NAME] is not merely competent in [field], but represents the extraordinary caliber of professional that EB-1A classification was designed to attract.

### C. Case Strength Summary

**Overall Assessment:** [STRONG/MODERATE/CHALLENGING] EB-1A CASE  
**Criteria Met:** [Number] of 10 (requires only 3)  
**Recommended Filing Strategy:** [Standard/Premium Processing with specific considerations]

---

## II. STRATEGIC POSITIONING

### A. Why This Matters for EB-1A

The distinction between [generic description] and [elevated professional description] is legally significant:

**Generic Positioning (Weaker):**
- Focuses only on [single aspect]
- Limited to [narrow accomplishments]
- Difficult to demonstrate sustained national/international acclaim
- May appear as merely [common profession description]

**Strategic Positioning (Stronger):**
- Encompasses [broader professional scope]
- Demonstrates excellence across [multiple dimensions]
- Shows [sustained contributions and impact]
- Positions as [elevated professional status]

### B. Field of Endeavor Definition

**Our Defined Field:** [Specific field description]

**Why This Definition Works:**
1. **Specificity**: Narrow enough to be meaningful but broad enough for evidence
2. **Recognition**: Aligns with how field is recognized in industry
3. **Measurability**: Allows for clear peer comparison
4. **USCIS Precedent**: Consistent with approved cases in similar fields

**Supporting Documentation:**
- Industry standards and definitions
- Professional organization classifications
- Media and publication categorizations
- Peer and expert recognition patterns

### C. Two-Step Kazarian Analysis Framework

Per *Kazarian v. USCIS* (2010), EB-1A petitions undergo two-step analysis:

**Step 1: Initial Evidence Evaluation**
- Does petitioner meet at least 3 of the 10 regulatory criteria?
- Is evidence properly documented and verified?
- Does evidence actually demonstrate the claimed criterion?

**Step 2: Final Merits Determination**
- Does the totality of evidence demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim?
- Is petitioner among the small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field?
- Will petitioner continue to work in their field of extraordinary ability in the United States?

**Our Strategy:**
- Meet [number] criteria clearly in Step 1
- Build comprehensive final merits case in Step 2
- Address both prongs with overwhelming evidence
